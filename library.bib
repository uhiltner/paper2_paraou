abstract = {Two billion ha have been identified globally for forest restoration. Our meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest restoration enhances biodiversity by 15–84{\%} and vegetation structure by 36–77{\%}, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

abstract = {Dendrochronological techniques have found limited applications in the tropics because of invisible or indistinct banding in wood. The seasonal cycles of rainfall and relative humidity in these regions, while not sufficient to produce distinct visible rings, may still generate seasonal signals in the oxygen isotopic composition of tree cellulose which can be used for climate reconstruction and chronology. We explore this approach using trees from Indonesia and Thailand, from three different families. Multi-decade ??18O records from Javanese cross-dated teak rings and bomb radiocarbon-dated Suar wood lacking visible rings demonstrate the reproducibility of the signal between trees grown at the same locality as well as from wider geographical regions. These results confirm predictions that the trees oxygen isotopic signatures reflect an external climatic forcing. High-resolution ??18O records reveal large seasonal cycles: up to 4??? for Javanese Suar samples and up to 18??? for a Thai Podocarpus sample. We show that the six ??18O and ??13C cycles measured on a Podocarpus match the number of growth years for the period spanning the time of wounding and cutting of the wedge section. This result demonstrates that the isotopic cycles found in this tree with indistinct annual rings are indeed seasonal and could be used for chronology. We present evidence that stable isotope chronologies of tropical trees also contain insights in tropical tree physiology and growth dynamics. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The overuse of rainforests in the last century and its consequences necessitate a rethinking of logging policies. To this end models have been developed to simulate rainforest dynamics and to allow optional management strategies to be evaluated. Parameterisation of presently existing models for a certain site needs a lot of work, thus the parameterisation effort is too high to apply the models to a wide range of rainforests. Hence, in this paper we introduce the simplified model FORREG using the knowledge we have gained from a more complex model, FORMIX3-Q. The FORREG model uses differential equations to determine the volume growth of three successional species groups. Parameterisation is simplified by a genetic algorithm, which determines the required internal model parameters from characteristics of the forest dynamics. The new model is employed to assess the sustainability of various logging policies in terms of yield and damage. Results for three forests are discussed: (1) the tropical lowland rain forest in the Deramakot Forest Reserve, (2) the Lambir National Park in Malaysia and (3) a subtropical forest in Paraguay. Our model reproduces both undisturbed forest dynamics and dynamics of logged forests simulated with FORMIX3-Q very well. However, the resultant volumes of yield and damage differ slightly from those gained by FORMIX3-Q if short logging cycles are simulated. Choosing longer logging cycles leads to a good correspondence of both models. For the Deramakot Forest Reserve different logging cycles are compared and discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present an extensive new network of ring-width chronologies, comprising data from 100 sites within the Austrian Eastern Alps, made up of multiple tree species. Principal components analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify five separate high-frequency tree-growth signals from these data. Tree-growth variability at these sites is explained by site altitude and species differences that moderate the effects of the annually varying climatic forcing on tree growth. Recently developed, two-century long gridded climate data sets for the Greater Alpine Region were used to assess the relationship between climate and tree growth. Tree growth at low altitudes is controlled mainly by spring-summer moisture availability. At high altitudes precipitation is no longer a limiting factor and growth is mostly determined by summer temperature. In the intermediate altitudinal range, we did not find any direct relationships with specific climatic variables. High-altitude chronologies suitable for reconstructing past temperatures and low-altitude chronologies suitable for reconstructing past precipitation were identified.},

abstract = {Long-term field studies in the scope of a multidisciplinary project in southern Ecuador revealed extraordinary high species numbers of many organismic groups. This article discusses reasons for the outstanding vascular plant diversity using a hierarchical scale-oriented top-down approach (Gr{\"{u}}ninger 2005), from the global scale to the local microscale. The global scale explains general (paleo-) ecological factors valid for most parts of the humid tropics, addressing various hypotheses and theories, such as the “greater effective evolutionary time”, constant input of “accidentals”, the “seasonal variability hypothesis”, the “intermediate disturbance hypothesis”, and the impact of soil fertility. The macroscale focuses on the Andes in northwestern South America. The tropical Andes are characterised by many taxa of restricted range which is particularly true for the Amotape-Huancabamba region, i.e. the so called Andean Depression, which is effective as discrete phytogeographic transition as well as barrier zone. Interdigitation of northern and southern flora elements, habitat fragmentation, geological and landscape history, and a high speciation rate due to rapid genetic radiation of some taxa contribute to a high degree of diversification. The mesoscale deals with the special environmental features of the eastern mountain range, the Cordillera Real and surrounding areas in southern Ecuador. Various climatic characteristics, the orographic heterogeneity, the geologic and edaphic conditions as well as human impact are the most prominent factors augmenting plant species diversity. On microscale, prevailing regimes of disturbance and environmental stresses, the orographic basement, as well as the general role on the various mountain chains are considered. Here, micro-habitats e.g. niches for epiphytes, effects of micro-relief patterns, and successions after small-sized disturbance events are screened. Direct effects of human impact are addressed and a perspective of possible effects of climate change on plant diversity is presented.},

@article{Hannah2002,
abstract = {Aim: Conservation strategies currently include little consideration of climate change. Insights about the biotic impacts of climate change from biogeography and palaeoecology, therefore, have the potential to provide significant improvements in the effectiveness of conservation planning. We suggest a collaboration involving biogeography, ecology and applied conservation. The resulting Climate Change-integrated Conservation Strategies (CCS) apply available tools to respond to the conservation challenges posed by climate change. Location: The focus of this analysis is global, with special reference to high biodiversity areas vulnerable to climate change, particularly tropical montane settings. Methods: Current tools from climatology, biogeography and ecology applicable to conservation planning in response to climate change are reviewed. Conservation challenges posed by climate change are summarized. CCS elements are elaborated that use available tools to respond to these challenges. Results: Five elements of CCS are described: regional modelling; expanding protected areas; management of the matrix; regional coordination; and transfer of resources. Regional modelling uses regional climate models, biotic response models and sensitivity analysis to identify climate change impacts on biodiversity at a regional scale appropriate for conservation planning. Expansion of protected areas management and systems within the planning region are based on modelling results. Management of the matrix between protected areas provides continuity for processes and species range shifts outside of parks. Regional coordination of park and off-park efforts allows harmonization of conservation goals across provincial and national boundaries. Finally, implementation of these CCS elements in the most biodiverse regions of the world will require technical and financial transfer of resources on a global scale. Main conclusions: Collaboration across disciplines is necessary to plan conservation responses to climate change adequately. Biogeography and ecology provide insights into the effects of climate change on biodiversity that have not yet been fully integrated into conservation biology and applied conservation management. CCS provide a framework in which biogeographers, ecologists and conservation managers can collaborate to address this need. These planning exercises take place on a regional level, driven by regional climate models as well as general circulation models (GCMs), to ensure that regional climate drivers such as land use change and mesoscale topography are adequately represented. Sensitivity analysis can help address the substantial uncertainty inherent in projecting future climates and biodiversity response. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2002 Wiley},

abstract = {The inverse system approximation using the finite impulse responses (FIR) and the corresponding model-order determination are essential to a broad area of science and technology utilizing signal processing. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no explicit formulation of the exact L2 approximation error for the truncated inverse filters. The approach to determine the minimum inverse model-order subject to the maximum allowable L2 approximation error is also in demand. In this paper, we present two L2 approximation error measures and the two corresponding optimal finite-support approximates. Also, we derive the explicit L2 approximation error functions with respect to roots, multiplicities and model orders for these two kinds of approximates. Then, we propose a new algorithm to determine the minimum total model order of the appropriate truncated inverse filter to achieve a specified L2 approximation error. Our newly derived L2 approximation error evaluation method can be employed for signal processing, telecommunication, control systems involving the inverse filtering in the future. Besides, our novel model-order determination algorithm can be utilized for efficient dynamic memory allocation in a wide variety of applications since such a minimum total model order is proportional to the memory usage for any inverse filter implementation.},

The latter describes a negotiated and contested fitness terrain. Individual and corporate actors simultaneously adapt to and actively manipulate this terrain by using alternative collective action frames, mobilizing resources, and creating or exploiting political opportunities in order to legitimate or delegitimate social structures and their associated technologies at various levels of analysis. Adaptation is conceptualized as occurring through homeostatic, developmental, rational choice, and populational mechanisms. Vulnerability results from the adaptive failure of social structures sustaining individual and collective health, livelihood, and well-being. This framework combines organizational sociologists' insights into structure–environment interaction; constructionists' attention to agency, language, culture, and values; and political ecologists' concerns with power, inequality, and processes of marginalization.},

abstract = {Tree species use a variety of strategies to obtain resources. As a result, semi-deciduous forest species and cerrado species can grow in close proximity and in the same climate, while occupying very different vegetation types. The aim of this study was to understand the dynamic responses of Hymenaea courbaril, a forest species, and Hymenaea stigonocarpa, a cerrado species, to annual climatic variation and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations under the same macroclimatic conditions. To that goal, we constructed chronologies of tree-ring width, vessel area, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (calculated from tree-ring $\delta$13C content) for Hymenaea trees growing in a mosaic of the two vegetation types. Our analyses revealed that both species responded to climatic variation in similar ways, but with different intensities and at different times of year. Climate models showed that precipitation had a stronger effect on tree-ring width and earlywood vessel area of H. courbaril and temperature was slightly more determinant for H. stigonocarpa. In addition, both species showed increasing intrinsic water-use efficiency over the last five decades, but only individuals with reduced growth rate presented this trend, suggesting that those specimens in favorable growth conditions do not respond to the atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Despite the trend in water-use efficiency found in some individuals, it did not reflect in a higher growth rate. The differences between the two species documented by us may be due to divergent sources of hydrological stress in the two vegetation types. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

To this end, we examined stem radial fluctuations in Quercus ilex L., the dominant evergreen oak species in the Western Mediterranean Basin, over a period of 11 years (1994-2004) at a coastal site in north-eastern Spain. We used manual band dendrometers to record girth changes in trees on north- and south-facing slopes. Annual increments measured by dendrometers showed good agreement with annual tree-ring width. North-facing trees showed a lower long-term cumulative radial increment than south-facing trees. The seasonal radial increment pattern of Q. ilex was bimodal, being characterized by a greater increase in May and a lesser, more variable increase peak in September. Both phases corresponded to warm and moist climatic conditions, whereas radial increase of stems stopped in winter and occasionally in summer. Considering the whole year, mean maximum air temperature was the main factor positively affecting radial increment of Q. ilex from short- (5 days) to- long (30 days) time scales, whereas the accumulated precipitation exerted a similar effect at longer (30 days) scales, but only on south-facing trees. In summer, all trees were positively correlated with precipitation at long-time scales (30 days); however, only stem increment of south-facing trees showed a significant relation to the temperature at short-time scales (10 days). We confirmed the dominant role of temperature as the major constraint on radial increment at short time scales, despite most previous studies were mostly biased towards precipitation effects at monthly scales.},

abstract = {Tropical forests contain an important proportion of the carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation, but estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests varies two-fold, with little consensus on the relative importance of climate, soil and forest structure in explaining spatial patterns. Here, we present analyses from a plot network designed to examine differences among contrasting forest habitats (terra firme, seasonally flooded, and white-sand forests) that span the gradient of climate and soil conditions of the Amazon basin.We installed 0.5-ha plots in 74 sites representing the three lowland forest habitats in both Loreto, Peru and French Guiana, and we integrated data describing climate, soil physical and chemical characteristics and stand variables, including local measures of wood specific gravity (WSG).We use a hierarchical model to separate the contributions of stand variables from climate and soil variables in explaining spatial variation in AGB. AGB differed among both habitats and regions, varying from 78Mgha?1 in white-sand forest in Peru to 605Mgha?1 in terra firme clay forest of French Guiana. Stand variables including tree size and basal area, and to a lesser extent WSG, were strong predictors of spatial variation in AGB. In contrast, soil and climate variables explained little overall variation in AGB, though they did co-vary to a limited extent with stand parameters that explained AGB. Our results suggest that positive feedbacks in forest structure and turnover controlAGB in Amazonian forests, with richer soils (Peruvian terra firme and all seasonally flooded habitats) supporting smaller trees with lower wood density and moderate soils (French Guianan terra firme) supporting many larger trees with high wood density. The weak direct relationships we observed between soil and climate variables and AGB suggest that the most appropriate approaches to landscape scale modeling of AGB in the Amazon would be based on remote sensing methods to map stand structure.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems are playing an increasingly important role in climate change mitigation through programs on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), which targets carbon sequestration. However, decades of environmental valuation studies evidence the economic benefits of other forest ecosystem services different than carbon, and there is no evidence on how these economic benefits differ in countries where REDD is to be implemented. To respond to this question, we conduct a global meta-analysis of forest primary studies published over the past 30. years in which we estimate the economic benefits related to different forest ecosystem services in targeted REDD countries, and discuss the implications of considering these economic figures in REDD decision making. A systematic review of the scientific literature leads to the selection of 52 original studies to conduct a meta-analysis on 205 observations. We obtain that the economic benefits of forest ecosystem services in REDD countries are always greater than in other countries, and provide economic ranges of services to serve as a reference to REDD decision making in relation to co-benefits and opportunity costs. The results have implications for future avoided deforestation programs, which should take co-benefits into account in order to better articulate payments for ecosystems and create proper incentives for forest conservation and sustain local livelihoods.},

Of particular importance are relative changes in SST between the hemispheres on decadal timescales, a phenomenon often called the Atlantic SST dipole1'5• Here we propose that the decadal variation in the tropical SST dipole may be attributed to an unstable thermo- dynamic ocean-atmosphere interaction between wind-induced heat fluxes and SST. Using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, we show that the coupled dipole mode has a typical oscillation period of about a decade. The notion that the Atlantic dipole-Iike SST variability may be related to an oscillatory coupled mode might assist attempts to predict decadal climate variability in the tropical Atlantic region.},

abstract = {* Reliable above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates are required for studies of carbon fluxes and stocks. However, there is a huge lack of knowledge concerning the precision of AGB estimates and the sources of this uncertainty. At the tree level, the tree height is predicted using the tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and a height sub-model. The wood-specific gravity (WSG) is predicted with taxonomic information and a WSG sub-model. The tree mass is predicted using the predicted height, the predicted WSG and the biomass sub-model. * Our models were inferred with Bayesian methods and the uncertainty propagated with a Monte Carlo scheme. The uncertainties in the predictions of tree height, tree WSG and tree mass were neglected sequentially to quantify their contributions to the uncertainty in AGB. The study was conducted in French Guiana where long-term research on forest ecosystems provided an outstanding data collection on tree height, tree dynamics, tree mass and species WSG. * We found that the uncertainty in the AGB estimates was found to derive primarily from the biomass sub-model. The models used to predict the tree heights and WSG contributed negligible uncertainty to the final estimate. * Considering our results, a poor knowledge of WSG and the height–diameter relationship does not increase the uncertainty in AGB estimates. However, it could lead to bias. Therefore, models and databases should be used with care. * This study provides a methodological framework that can be broadly used by foresters and plant ecologist. It provides the accurate confidence intervals associated with forest AGB estimates made from inventory data. When estimating region-scale AGB values (through spatial interpolation, spatial modelling or satellite signal treatment), the uncertainty of the forest AGB value in the reference forest plots has to be taken in account. We believe that in the light of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation debate, our method is a crucial step in monitoring carbon stocks and their spatio-temporal evolution.},

Samples were collected in an old growth subalpine forest in the remote Kwadacha Wilderness Provincial Park. Two chronologies were created, one using standard dendroclimatological methods and one through the use of principal components analysis. The ring-width chronologies both showed a strong positive relationship with minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures during the current growing season. The principal component based chronology was deemed superior for use as a proxy record due to its greater ability to explain the variance in the instrumental temperature record and stronger performance during reconstruction verification. Comparison of this reconstruction with other dendroclimatological reconstructions from western Canada revealed a coherent pattern of low-frequency variability, whereas comparisons at annual times-scales showed considerable temporal and spatial variability in the level of agreement between reconstructions. The northern Canadian Rocky Mountains reconstruction showed no evidence of the reduction in sensitivity to climatic variability that has been found in many other northern spruce chronologies during the late 20th century. ?? 2010 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Associations with topographic units or soil types that vary in water availability are widespread in plant communities and are one of the main structuring aspects for local species distribution patterns, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that differential seedling performance across habitats, particularly during the dry season, leads to habitat associations in seasonal tropical forests. We expected this pattern to be most pronounced in particularly dry years, such as those associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. We assessed performance of 36 native tree and shrub species in a moist forest in central Panama across the dry and wet seasons in two topographic habitat types during a year in which dry-season precipitation was reduced due to an ENSO event. At the community level, we found lower growth and higher mortality in the dry season relative to the wet season and higher mortality in the drier plateau habitat relative to the wetter slope habitat. There was large variation in species' responses to season and habitat. Species' mortality and growth rates were significantly correlated with experimentally assessed drought sensitivity, but only during the dry season in the plateau habitat. Slope specialists had significantly higher survival, but not growth, in the slope vs. plateau habitat during the dry season. In contrast, plateau specialists showed no performance differences between habitats. The data suggest that associations with plateau habitats result from a numerical advantage of drought-tolerant species in dry habitats in which seedlings of drought-sensitive species are unable to persist. Overall, our results support the idea that seasonal and spatial variation in water availability, particularly in dry years, drive seedling dynamics, which in turn shape local species distributions. Predicted shifts in rainfall patterns caused by global and regional climate change are therefore expected to alter the dynamics, composition, and diversity of seasonal tropical forests.},

abstract = {using an individual-oriented forest growth model for analyses of logging and fragmentation in three case studies For answering questions concerning anthropogeneous impacts on tropical forest development the individual-oriented and process-based forest growth model Formind2.0 was developed. It simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of uneven-aged mixed forest stands in areas of one hectare to several km2. The model describes forest dynamics as a mosaic of interacting forest patches of 20 m2×20 m2 in size. Within these patches trees are not spatial-explicitly distributed, and thus all compete for light and space following the gap model approach. Tree species diversity is aggregated into 5-20 plant functional types (PFT) on the basis of species maximum tree height and successional status. The carbon balance of each individual tree incl. photosynthesis and respiration is modelled explicitly. Thus, we can match measured diameter increment for different PFT, size and light conditions accurately. Allometric relationships connect above-ground biomass, stem diameter, tree height and crown dimensions. Beside increasing mortality through self-thinning in dense plots one of the main processes of mortality is gap creation by falling of large trees. This process as well as seed dispersal from mature trees interlinks neighbouring plots with each other. The model was parametrised for three different sites in South-East Asia and south- America: Sabah (Malaysia), Venezuela, and French Guiana. Model accuracy is tested with growth data from permanent sampling plots in Sabah. Sensitivity of various result variables on variation of most parameter values is tested and gives important insights into general model behaviour. Two examples of anthropogeneous impacts on tropical forest dynamics are management practise and fragmentation, both of major concern. Following applications are performed: Growth and yield of Venezuelan rain forest under various logging methods, intensities and cycles are analysed for their sustainability. Effects of logging (methods and cycles), fragmentation and recruitment assumptions on forest dynamics in Sabah are discussed. Finally, fragmentation impacts on mortality and recruitment are simulated and their effects on forest dynamic and biomass loss are evaluated for a forest site in French Guiana.},

abstract = {The use of dendroecological techniques to describe temporal patterns of disturbances and forest dynamics has been largely restricted to high-latitude ecosystems. In this review, we present the results of recent developments in subtropical northwestern Argentina (22-28??S). The area is characterized by a subtropical monsoonal climate (wet summers, dry winters) which implies that some species respond to climatic seasonality by producing annual tree rings. Alnus acuminata, a deciduous species that dominates the upper montane forests (1700-2700 m), has been successfully used to describe patterns of forest regeneration, fire, landslides, and floods by dating scars, establishment events and changes in growth patterns and to relate these patterns with climate and land use during the twentieth century. Establishment dates, growth releases, and resprout dates of species with annual tree rings (e.g. Cedrela lilloi, Solanum riparium, Cinammomum porphyria) have been used in lower montane forests to describe regeneration dynamics in relation to treefall gaps. These results indicate that dendroecology is a feasible and promising research line that needs further exploration in this geographical area. Among the research priorities we identified are: (1) exploration of the use of these species in forests of lower latitudes (e.g. southern Peru and Bolivia), (2) increase of sample sizes and target species, in order to extend the temporal and spatial domains of these studies, (3) explore the use of other species in the same area to study other ecological processes or the same ones in different environments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we test the extent to which climate variables related to water regime, temperature and irradiance shape the growth trajectories of neotropical trees. • We developed a diameter growth model explicitly designed to work with asynchronous climate and growth data. Growth trajectories of 205 individual trees from 54 neotropical species censused every 2 months over a 4-year period were used to rank 9 climate variables and find the best predictive model. • About 9{\%} of the individual variation in tree growth was imputable to the seasonal variation of climate. Relative extractable water was the main predictor and alone explained more than 60{\%} of the climate effect on tree growth, i.e. 5.4{\%} of the individual variation in tree growth. Furthermore, the global annual tree growth was more dependent on the diameter increment at the onset of the rain season than on the duration of dry season. • The best predictive model included 3 climate variables: relative extractable water, minimum temperature and irradiance. The root mean squared error of prediction (0.035 mm x d(-1)) was slightly above the mean value of the growth (0.026 mm x d(-1)). • Amongst climate variables, we highlight the predominant role of water availability in determining seasonal variation in tree growth of neotropical forest trees and the need to include these relationships in forest simulators to test, in silico, the impact of different climate scenarios on the future dynamics of the rainforest.},

abstract = {Certification to approved forest management standards is a recognized business practice. There are two international forest certification programs: the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The common objective of both is to improve forest management and provide assurance to the public and customers that forest products come from sustainably managed forests and not from illegal operations. As of June 2011 there were approximately 372 million ha of certified forests around the world. There are 234 million ha of forests in 26 countries that have been certified to standards approved by PEFC. There are143 million ha of forest certified to FSC standards in 81 countries. In 20 of these countries, with101 million ha (70{\%}), the forests have been certified to standards approved by FSC. In the remaining 61 countries, 42 million ha (30{\%}), the forests have been certified to draft or "interim standards" that have not gone through the FSC approval process. Consumers have no way of knowing whether the wood or paper products with an FSC label are from forests certified to FSC-approved standards or to "interim standards" developed by FSC certification bodies.},

abstract = {A collection of 28 tree-ring chronologies from six different species located in northern Pakistan were evaluated in terms of their potential for dendroclimatic reconstructions. 15 of the sites are new while the remaining 13 (all Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb.) have been reported earlier. Several species had trees attaining ages of around 700 years (Cedrus deodara (D. Don) G. Don, Pinus gerardiana Wall. ex D. Don., Pinus wallichiana A.B. Jacks and Picea smithiana (Wall.) Boiss.) but the juniper was clearly the oldest with some trees greater than 1000 years. Correlations between the site chronologies declined with increasing separation distance. This was consistently seen both between sites of the same species and between sites composed of different species. This led to a situation where a much stronger correlation occurred between two different species growing at the same site than between sites of the same species but separated by as little as 0.5. km. Such results highlight the obvious strong elevational gradients present in this mountainous region (where some elevations are over 7000. m). They also lend support to the practice of multi-species combinations for better spatial and temporal coverage. The best prospects for this appear to be C. deodara and P. gerardiana and are consistent with studies from neighbouring India. The comparison to 0.5° gridded climate data was strongest from the same two species though P. smithiana at one site was also highly significant. A general climate correlation pattern from all species was evident that starts with a strong negative relationship to temperature in the previous October, then turns towards positive during winter, before again becoming significantly negative by the current May. The previous October signal is thought to be a lag effect where hot temperatures (and low soil-moisture) stress the trees, thereby reducing reserves available for the following spring. Similarly, hot temperatures in late spring (May) lead to greater soil moisture losses and tree transpiration costs. Conversely, there is an extended strong positive precipitation correlation from late winter to spring (January-May). This ends abruptly and there is no evidence of a summer (June-September) monsoon signal seen in the rainfall correlation functions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the East African March–May ‘‘long rains.'' Particularly, it investigates the atmospheric patterns associated to the March–May rainfall anomalies, then proposes a seasonal prediction model. In a preliminary step, in order to define a regional rainfall index, a new form of extended principal component analysis is performed, aimed at capturing both the spatial and intraseasonal rainfall coherence. What emerges is that although the long rains exhibit a low temporal coherence, calling for a separation between the months of March–April and May in teleconnection studies, they show a relatively strong spatial consistency over the Kenya–Uganda inland region. From composite analyses performed using NCEP–NCAR reanalyzed atmospheric data, three major signals appear for that region. Two are during March–April involving ENSO and the latitudinal location of the ITCZ, and ENSO interactions with the northern extratropical dynamics (by way of cool surges toward the Tropics and upper-ridge–trough systems). The third signal is the Asian monsoon in May. As shown using a rainfall index for Ethiopia, the interactions with the midlatitudes get stronger when considering rainfall farther to the north. The predictability study identifies four February indexes, involving several scales and several atmospheric and oceanic parameters, to serve as predictors in linear multiple regression (LMR) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models. The predictors, selected by a stepwise procedure, depict both regional (energy gradient and zonal wind) and remote dynamics (ENSO and 500-hPa geopotential height over the Near East): they are consistent with the signals shown in the synchronous composites. The robustness of the LMR and LDA models is demonstrated by the high linear error in probability space (LEPS) scores (44{\%} for continuous variables and 51{\%} for categorical variables) obtained on cross-validated results. 1.},

abstract = {Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, as they store a large amount of carbon (C). Tropical forest deforestation has been identified as a major source of CO2 emissions, though biomass loss due to fragmentation—the creation of additional forest edges—has been largely overlooked as an additional CO2 source. Here, through the combination of remote sensing and knowledge on ecological processes, we present long-term carbon loss estimates due to fragmentation of Neotropical forests: within 10 years the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has lost 69 (±14) Tg C, and the Amazon 599 (±120) Tg C due to fragmentation alone. For all tropical forests, we estimate emissions up to 0.2 Pg C y−1 or 9 to 24{\%} of the annual global C loss due to deforestation. In conclusion, tropical forest fragmentation increases carbon loss and should be accounted for when attempting to understand the role of vegetation in the global carbon balance.},

abstract = {We established a chronology of monsoonal temperate glacier fluctuations in China during the last two millennia based on radiocarbon ages of fossil wood buried in moraines, lichen-dated moraines and tree ring evidence. The chronology includes data from 16 glaciers in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau including the Hengduan Mountains, the central and eastern parts of the Himalaya Mountains, and the eastern Nyainqentanglha Range. Three main periods of glacier advances are identified: around 200-600 AD, 800-1150 AD, and 1400-1920 AD. The glacier advance at about 400-600 AD was the most widespread advance in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Basically synchronous glacier advances occurred in the southern Himalayan Mountains during 380-600 AD, 870-1100 AD, 1400-1430 AD and 1550-1850 AD. The glacier advance around 1000 AD also occurred in the central Himalayas. Temperatures in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau calculated from Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) depression were 1.0 °C, 0.7 °C, 0.4 °C and 0.1 °C lower than at present (1989 AD) during the periods of 200-600 AD, 800-1150 AD, 1400-1650 AD, and the 19th century, respectively. On a centennial timescale, temperature changes rather than precipitation changes caused by variations of the south Asian summer monsoon are the controlling factor for glacier fluctuations. The widespread glacier advance during the 19th century was probably partly attributable to the result of increased winter snowfall in the central Himalayas. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fewstudies of land-use/land-cover change provide an integrated assessment of the driving forces and consequences of that change, particularly in Africa. Our objectives were to determine howdriving forces at different scales change over time, how these forces affect the dynamics and patterns of land use/land cover, and how land-use/land-cover change affects ecological properties at the landscape scale. To accomplish these objectives, we first developed a way to identify the causes and consequences of change at a landscape scale by integrating tools from ecology and the social sciences and then applied these methods to a case study in Ghibe Valley, southwestern Ethiopia. Maps of land-use/land-cover change were created from aerial photography and Landsat TM imagery for the period, 1957– 1993. A method called ‘ecological time lines' was developed to elicit landscape-scale explanations for changes from long-term residents. Cropland expanded at twice the speed recently (1987–1993) than two decades ago (1957–1973), but also contracted rapidly between 1973–1987. Rapid land-use/land cover change was caused by the combined effects of drought and migration, changes in settlement and land tenure policy, and changes in the severity of the livestock disease, trypanosomosis,which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. The scale of the causes and consequences of land-use/land-cover change varied from local to sub-national (regional) to international and the links between causes and consequences crossed scales. At the landscape scale, each cause affected the location and pattern of land use/land cover differently. The contraction of cropland increased grass biomass and cover, woody plant cover, the frequency and extent of savanna burning, and the abundance of wildlife. With recent control of the tsetse fly, these ecological changes are being reversed. These complex patterns are discussed in the context of scaling issues and current conceptual models of land-use/land-cover change.},

If one is mainly interested in parameter estimation, this can be done with simple global stochastic search methods, while uncertainty analysis is carried out with traditional first-order analysis, which significantly reduces the number of needed model evaluations. Within a nonlinear regression framework, where the misfit between model and observations is expressed as a sum of weighted squares, we model the dynamics of tropical forest with a size-structured Sinko-Streifer model and demonstrate the general calibration procedure on a virtual data set. A second case study on real data for a single species shows that surprisingly total stem number, basal area and aboveground biomass are the minimum observations needed for successful calibration. A third case study on real data for a three species group shows the prediction of successional states while only using the former reduced set of observations for calibration. The methodology is well suited for time consuming models, where only limited amount of forest site observations are available.},

abstract = {Experience with companies, using single-tree selection systems for logging in Sarawak, shows that they are generally guided only by basic statutory harvesting rules like minimum diameter limits, maximum gap size and permitted species. At best, silvicultural considerations are typically only implied in the harvesting rules, rather than being explicitly considered in harvest planning and operations. Increasingly, companies are moving towards 100 percent enumeration of trees and tree mapping using GPS as part of reduced or low-impact logging systems. Use of GPS results in a spatial database of trees and key descriptors that could be used to plan future activities by modeling growth and yield to forecast key forest parameters, such as DBH and species, and to map the location of trees. Doing this would help to shift the focus of harvest planners and surveyors from operational to silvicultural considerations such as spacing, recruitment, and future crop trees, when planning harvesting. The main reason why companies are not doing this type of planning now is that the common tropical forest models use area-based parameters (whole stand models, size class models) that are only relevant to large scale planning. Typically these models do not make use of the spatial data that is generated in logging planning, require significantly more and different data that what is used in planning logging operations, and do not produce outputs that are relevant to operational harvest planning. What would be more useful are single- tree models that make use of spatial data, and that produce output that is operationally relevant, including diameter, species, and location of trees. The paper outlines operational requirements of reduced and low-impact logging systems and recommends yield modelling approaches that would work with these systems.},

abstract = {Most plant species feature similar biochemical compositions and thus similar spectral signals. Still, empirical evidence suggests that the spectral discrimination of species and plant assemblages is possible. Success depends on the presence or absence of faint but detectable differences in biochemical (e.g., pigments, leaf water and dry matter content) and structural properties (e.g., leaf area, angle, and leaf structure), i.e., optical traits. A systematic analysis of the contributions and spatio-temporal variability of optical traits for the remote sensing of organismic vegetation patterns has not yet been conducted. We thus use time series of optical trait values retrieved from the reflectance signal using physical models (optical trait indicators, OTIs) to answer the following questions: How are optical traits related among patterns of floristic composition and reflectance? How variable are these relations in space and time? Are OTIs suitable predictors of plant species composition? We conducted a case study of three temperate open study sites with semi-natural vegetation. The canopy reflectance of permanent vegetation plots was measured on multiple dates over the vegetation period using a field spectrometer. We recorded the cover fractions of all plant species found in the vegetation plots and extracted gradients of species composition from these data. The physical PROSAIL leaf and canopy optical properties model was inverted with random forest regression models to retrieve time series of OTIs for each plot from the reflectance spectra. We analyzed these data sets using correlation analyses. This approach allowed us to assess the distribution of optical traits across gradients of species composition. The predictive performance of OTIs was tested in relation to canopy reflectance using random forest models. OTIs showed pronounced relationships with floristic patterns in all three study sites. These relationships were subject to considerable temporal variability. Such variability was driven by short-term vegetation dynamics introduced by local resource stress. In 72{\%} of all cases OTIs out-performed the original canopy reflectance spectra as indicators of plant species composition. OTIs are also easier to interpret in an ecological sense than spectral bands or features. We thus conclude that optical traits retrieved from reflectance data have a high indicative value for ecological research and applications.},

The human population dynamics of these areas, however, are not well quantified.

We estimate that in 1995 more than 1.1 billion people, nearly 20{\%} of world population, were living within the hotspots, an area covering about 12{\%} of Earth's terrestrial surface. We estimate that the population growth rate in the hotspots (1995-2000) is 1.8{\%} yr(-1), substantially higher than the population growth rate of the world as a whole (1.3{\%} yr(-1)) and above that of the developing countries (1.6{\%} yr(-1)). These results suggest that substantial human-induced environmental changes are likely to continue in the hotspots and that demographic change remains an important factor in global biodiversity conservation. The results also underline the potential conservation significance of the continuing worldwide declines in human fertility and of policies and programs that influence human migration.},

abstract = {Trees growing in a seasonally tropical dry forest, with its characteristic 5–7-mo rainless interval, possess a variety of physiological adaptations to drought, the most common being leaf abscission. At the Estacion Biologia de Chamela in western Mexico, we experimentally examined the relationship between one-time experimental irrigation ranging as 0 (control) to 200 mm, and (1) the degree of bud burst (and, for a single species, flowering), and (2) the formation of a false ring. Additionally, we used long-term records at a nearby meteorological station to determine the probability of a rain event exceeding a particular intensity (mm). For our seven species (particularly the two most common species: Cordia alliodora and Piptadenia constricta ), we found that the degree of budburst and leaf extension was a function of irrigation intensity. In no case, however, did we find false rings, or indeed any indication of cambial activity initiated by the irrigation event. Further, there was no effect of intensity on subsequent relative growth rate in the following wet season. While sufficient rainfall (200 mm) to cause full leaf deployment is rare, nonetheless we estimate that a canopy tree in the study area would experience an event of this magnitude at least a few times per century. In any case, it will have no effect on the reliability of annual rings in this biome, nor any effect on diameter growth in (at least) the following year.},

abstract = {Little is known about the differences in physiology between temperate and tropical trees. Australian rainforests extend from tropical climates in the north to temperate climates in the south over a span of 33degrees latitude. Therefore, they provide an opportunity to investigate differences in the physiology of temperate and tropical trees within the same vegetation type. This study investigated how the response of net photosynthesis to growth temperature differed between Australian temperate and tropical rainforest trees and how this correlated with differences in their climates. The temperate species showed their maximum rate of net photosynthesis at lower growth temperatures than the tropical species. However, the temperate species showed at least 80{\%} of maximum net photosynthesis over a 12-16degreesC span of growth temperature, compared with a span of 9-11degreesC shown by the tropical species. The tropical species showed both larger reductions in maximum net photosynthesis at low growth temperatures and larger reductions in the optimum instantaneous temperature for net photosynthesis with decreasing growth temperature than the temperate species. The ability of the temperate species to maintain maximum net photosynthesis over a greater span of growth temperatures than the tropical species is consistent with the greater seasonal and day-to-day variation in temperature of the temperate climate compared with the tropical climate.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a strong global carbon sink over recent decades, with a substantial fraction of this sink probably located in the tropics, particularly in the Amazon. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.},

abstract = {Many tropical regions show one distinct dry season. Often, this seasonality induces cambial dor-mancy of trees, particularly if these belong to deciduous species. This will often lead to the formation of annual rings. The aim of this study was to determine whether tree species in the Bolivian Amazon region form annual rings and to study the influence of the total amount and seasonal distribution of rainfall on diameter growth. Ring widths were measured on stem discs of a total of 154 trees belonging to six rain forest species. By corre-lating ring width and monthly rainfall data we proved the annual character of the tree rings for four of our study species. For two other species the annual character was proved by counting rings on trees of known age and by radiocarbon dating. The results of the climate– growth analysis show a positive relationship between tree growth and rainfall in certain periods of the year, indicating that rainfall plays a major role in tree growth. Three species showed a strong relationship with rainfall at the beginning of the rainy season, while one species is most sensitive to the rainfall at the end of the previous growing season. These results clearly demonstrate that tree ring analysis can be successfully applied in the tropics and that it is a promising method for various research disciplines.},

This article shines light on the need to better understand how regime complexes manage overlaps. In developing this understanding, the article explores overlaps and coordination in the forest regime complex. By examining the work of an informal high level agency, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, the article investigates how coordination in a dense regime complex could be achieved. In pursuing this analysis, the article draws lessons for how to manage increasingly complex problems that interacting planetary boundaries could give rise to. The article draws on the literatures of institutional interplay and institutional design in order to understand the more subtle forms of institutional decision-making. The article shows that there are many overlaps among international institutions with forest related mandate, and identifies the innovative mechanism as important in managing these linkages, although it does not take part in actual decision-making. In sum, the article's findings suggest that carefully designed mechanisms might be one way to, if not to overcome, at least to facilitate the institutional response of governance challenges in the complex setting of planetary boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We explore the applicability of stable isotope dendroclimatology as a tool for chronology and paleo-hydrology reconstruction on deciduous trees from monsoonal northern Thailand. Analysis of 11 trees coming from 4 different regions of northern Thailand yielded 7 records with varying degrees of ?? 18O and ?? 13C seasonality. We develop age models for trees lacking visible rings based on the seasonality of the ?? 18O and find agreement to within ???3 years with radiocarbon age estimates. We use the isotopic age models to reconstruct estimates of growth rates and find a significant positive correlation between growth and amplitude of the oxygen and carbon seasonal isotopic signals. A comparison of a reconstructed dendro-isotopic index from Pangmapa with regional rainfall records indicates significant correlations consistent with the locally derived patterns but with decreased representation of the variance. Individual isotopic chronologies stemming from different tree species share common trends, which are also consistent with patterns of rainfall variability. We see an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal ?? 18O cycle along with an increase in ?? 18O max over the past few decades suggesting a tracking of the recent drying trend of Thailand's monsoon. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There are pressing reasons for developing a better understanding of net primary production (NPP) in the world's forests. These ecosystems play a large role in the world's carbon budget, and their dynamics, which are likely to be responding to global changes in climate and atmospheric composition, have major economic implications and impacts on global biodiversity. Although there is a long history of forest NPP studies in the ecological literature, current understanding of ecosystem-level production remains limited. Forest NPP cannot be directly measured; it must be approached by indirect methods. To date, field measurements have been largely restricted to a few aspects of NPP; methods are still lacking for field assessment of others, and past studies have involved confusion about the types of measurements needed. As a result, existing field-based estimates of forest NPP are likely to be significant underestimates. In this paper we provide a conceptual framework to guide efforts toward improved estimates of forest NPP. We define the quantity NPP* as the summed classes of organic material that should be measured or estimated in field studies for an estimate of total NPP. We discuss the above- and belowground components of NPP* and the available methods for measuring them in the field. We then assess the implications of the limitations of past studies for current understanding of NPP in forest ecosystems, discuss how field NPP* measurements can be used to complement tower-based studies of forest carbon flux, and recommend design criteria for future field studies of forest NPP.},

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no explicit formulation of the exact L2 approximation error for the truncated inverse filters. The approach to determine the minimum inverse model-order subject to the maximum allowable L2 approximation error is also in demand. In this paper, we present two L2 approximation error measures and the two corresponding optimal finite-support approximates. Also, we derive the explicit L2 approximation error functions with respect to roots, multiplicities and model orders for these two kinds of approximates. Then, we propose a new algorithm to determine the minimum total model order of the appropriate truncated inverse filter to achieve a specified L2 approximation error. Our newly derived L2 approximation error evaluation method can be employed for signal processing, telecommunication, control systems involving the inverse filtering in the future. Besides, our novel model-order determination algorithm can be utilized for efficient dynamic memory allocation in a wide variety of applications since such a minimum total model order is proportional to the memory usage for any inverse filter implementation.},

abstract = {Fast-growing exotic trees are widely planted in the tropics to counteract deforestation; however, their patterns of water use could be detrimental to overall ecosystem productivity through their impact on ecosystem water budget. In a comparative field study on seasonal soil-plant water dynamics of two exotic species (Cupressus lusitanica Mill. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and the indigenous Podocarpus falcatus (Thunb.) Mirb. in south Ethiopia, we combined a 2.5-year record for climate and soil water availability, natural-abundance oxygen isotope ratios (delta(18)O) of soil and xylem water, destructive root sampling and transpiration measurements. Soil was generally driest under C. lusitanica with its dense canopy and shallow root system, particularly following a relatively low-rainfall wet season, with the wettest soil under E. globulus. Wet season transpiration of C. lusitanica was twice that of the other species. In the dry season, P. falcatus and C. lusitanica reduced transpiration by a factor of six and two, respectively, whereas E. globulus showed a fivefold increase. In all species, there was a shift in water uptake to deeper soil layers as the dry season progressed, accompanied by relocation of live fine root biomass (LFR) of C. lusitanica and P. falcatus to deeper layers. Under P. falcatus, variability in soil matric potential, narrow delta(18)O depth gradients and high LFR indicated fast water redistribution. Subsoil water uptake was important only for E. globulus, which had low topsoil LFR and tap roots exploiting deep water. Although P. falcatus appeared better adapted to varying soil water availability than the exotic species, both conifers decreased growth substantially during dry weather. Growth of E. globulus was largely independent of topsoil water content, giving it the potential to cause substantial dry-season groundwater depletion.},

abstract = {Damage caused by reduced-impact logging (RIL) was assessed in 18 plots 1 ha each in a terra firme rain forest of Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Mean logging intensity was 6 trees ha-1 and the resulting commercial volume 21 m3 ha-1. On average, logging damage affected 16{\%} of the original stand while skidtrails occupied 7{\%} (661 m2 ha-1) of forest soil area. Canopy openness doubled to a mean of 11{\%}. Of the variables studied, "number of trees harvested or felled per plot" gave the best correlation to "proportion of damaged or destroyed trees". Damage to each diameter class was distributed in accordance with relative abundance of trees (dbh ??? 20 cm) in the original population before logging, suggesting that all diameter classes were affected equally. The sustainability of timber management applying RIL was evaluated through the calculation of the recovery level of commercial trees in three different scenarios. In the most optimistic scenario (growth rate of 5 mm year-1 and 1{\%} annual mortality), after 30 years, only 50{\%} of the commercial stand would recover, provoking a drastic reduction of the harvesting intensity at the second felling cycle. Within a 30-year felling cycle (i.e. the legal felling cycle duration in the Brazilian Amazon) and even under RIL systems, the present logging intensity occurring in the study area (6 trees ha-1) is not compatible with sustainable yield production on a long-term basis. For the study area, only the implementation of silvicultural treatment ensuring that the remaining potential crop trees grow at 4-5 mm year-1 would guarantee a logging intensity of 3-4 trees ha-1 (10-14 m3 ha-1) 40 years after the first harvest. This study showed that in the Amazon, RIL alone is clearly not sufficient to achieve sustainable forest management. More sophisticated silvicultural systems must be urgently elaborated and implemented to ensure that the forest will still be sustainably managed on a long-term basis. This issue is particularly important in the case of Brazil as a new law allowing the creation of 500,000 km2 of forest concessions by 2010 has been recently approved by the congress. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity2–5 . So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change6 . Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth7 , we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and air- borne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosys- tem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest dis- tribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite in- creasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also ap- parently become more dynamic.

abstract = {This review analyses the environmental evolution of the Ethiopian highlands in the late Quaternary. The late Pleistocene (20,000-12,000 14C years BP) was cold and dry, with (1) low lake levels in the Rift Valley, (2) large debris fans on the flanks of Lake Abh{\'{e}} basin, and (3) the Blue Nile transporting coarse bedload. Then, a period with abundant and less seasonal rains existed between 11,500 and 4800 14C years BP, as suggested by increased arboreal pollen, high river and lake levels, low river turbidities and soil formation. Around 5000-4800 14C years BP, there was a shift to more arid conditions and more soil erosion. Many phenomena that were previously interpreted as climate-driven might, however, well be of anthropic origin. Thick sediment deposits on pediments as well as an increase of secondary forest, scrub and ruderal species in pollen diagrams are witnesses of this human impact. One important aspect of the late Quaternary palaeoenvironment is unclear: changes in Nile flow discharges and Rift Valley lake levels have been linked to changes in precipitation depth. Most authors do not take into account changes in land use in the highlands, nor changes in the seasonality of rain, both of which can lead to a change in runoff coefficients. Tufa and speleothem deposition around 14,000 years ago tend to indicate that at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), conditions might have been wetter than generally accepted. The most important present-day geomorphic processes are sheet and rill erosion throughout the country, gullying in the highlands, and wind erosion in the Rift Valley and the peripheral lowlands. Based on existing sediment yield data for catchments draining the central and northern Ethiopian highlands, an equation was developed allowing to assess area-specific sediment yields: SY=2595A-0.29 (n=20; r2=0.59) where SY=area-specific sediment yield (t km-2 year-1), and A =drainage area (km2). With respect to recent environmental changes, temporal rain patterns, apart from the catastrophic impact of dry years on the degraded environment, cannot explain the current desertification in the driest parts of the country and the accompanying land degradation elsewhere. Causes are changing land use and land cover, which are expressions of human impact on the environment. Deforestation over the last 2000-3000 years was probably not a linear process in Ethiopia. Studies on land use and land cover change show, however, a tendency over the last decades of increasing removal of remnant vegetation, which is slowed down or reversed in northern Ethiopia by a set-aside policy. Ongoing land degradation requires urgent action at different levels of society. Soil and water conservation (SWC) structures are now widely implemented. Local knowledge and farmer's initiatives are integrated with introduced SWC techniques at various degrees. Impact assessments show clear benefits of the soil conservation measures in controlling runoff and soil erosion. In high rain areas, runoff management requires greater emphasis during the design of soil conservation structures. In such areas, investment in SWC might not be profitable at farm level, although benefits for society are positive. This pleads in favour of public support. The present land degradation in the Ethiopian highlands has a particular origin, which includes poverty and lack of agricultural intensification. Causes of these are to be found in the nature of past and present regional social relations as well as in international unequal development. This review strengthens our belief that, under improved socio-economic conditions, land husbandry can be made sustainable, leading to a reversal of the present desertification and land degradation of the Ethiopian highlands. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In an old-growth tropical wet forest at La Selva, Costa Rica, we combined radiocarbon (C-14) dating and tree-ring analysis to estimate the ages of large trees of canopy and emergent species spanning a broad range of wood densities and growth rates. We collected samples from the trunks, of 29 fallen, dead individuals. We found that all eight sampled species formed visible growth rings, which varied considerably in distinctiveness. For five of the six species for which we combined wood anatomical studies with C-14-dates (ring ages), the analyses demonstrated that growth rings were of annual formation. The oldest tree we found by direct ring counting was a Hymenolobium mesoamericanum Lima (Papilionaceae) specimen, with an age of ca. 530 years at the time of death. All other sampled individuals, including very large trees of slow-growing species, had died at ages between 200 and 300 years. These results show that, even in an everwet tropical rain forest, tree growth of many species can be rhythmic, with an annual periodicity. This study thus raises the possibility of extending tree-ring analyses throughout the tropical forest types lacking a strong dry season or annual flooding. Our findings and similar measurements from other tropical forests indicate that the maximum ages of tropical emergent trees are unlikely to be much greater than 600 years, and that these trees often die earlier from various natural causes},

abstract = {In this paper a new model for simulation of the growth of tropical rain forest is presented (FORMIX3). The model describes growth, mortality, recruitment of trees and competition between trees. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. The carbon gain of a tree depends on the photo production of its leaves, respiration and other losses. Trees compete for light and space. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Based on an extensive field data review, a parametrisation was developed for the simulation of lowland Dipterocarp rain forest at Deramakot, Malaysia. A total of 28 variables describing different aspects of forest structure and growth were compared with field data. The model reproduces most parts of the forest dynamics well. A new concept for sensitivity analysis is presented: 46 Model parameter were varied and analysed in respect to their influence on 26 variables describing the forest state. The influence of the different processes on forest structure is complex. Some general trends can be observed: The growth characteristics of the two Dipterocarp species groups strongly influences species composition in the forest, but not general forest structure (biomass, leaf area, production, leaf area, tree size distribution) (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Especially in combination with the ongoing tree harvesting in this region the recruitment threat imposes a severe danger on the species richness and forest structure of the whole area. We here assess with the process-based forest growth model FORMIND2.0 the impacts of common tree-logging strategies in those recruitment endangered forests. FORMIND2.0 is based on the calculations of the carbon balance of individual trees belonging to 13 different plant functional types. Even single logging events in those rainforests threatened by a lack of recruitment led to shifts in the abundances of species, to species loss, and to forest decline and dieback. The results show that current logging practices in South-East Asia seriously overuse the forests especially in the light of changing climate conditions},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

@article{Bontemps2011,
abstract = {Dendrochronological methods have greatly contributed to the documentation of past long-term trends in forest growth. As these methods primarily focus on the high-frequency signals of tree ring chronologies, they require the removal of the ageing trend in tree growth, known as 'standardisation' or 'detrending', as a prerequisite to the estimation of such trends. Because the approach is sequential, it may however absorb part of the low-frequency historical signal. In this study, we investigate the effect of a sequential and a simultaneous estimation of the ageing trend on the chronology of growth. We formerly developed a method to estimate historical changes in growth, including a careful control of site fertility in the sampling design and a simultaneous separation of the site fertility, developmental stage, and calendar year effects on growth, using a statistical modelling (SM) approach. The method has been applied to the radial growth of dominant trees in even-aged stands of common beech in north-eastern France. We compare the SM method to the regional curve standardisation (RCS) method, which is widely used in dendrochronology, and has been proven to retain more long-term signals than other detrending techniques. We also test a variant of the RCS in which the developmental stage is measured by size rather than age, as is the case in the SM approach. The SM and RCS methods produce similar long-term chronologies, showing an increase of approximately 50{\%} in radial growth over the 20th century and a recent decline of around 18{\%} in magnitude. The negative bias induced by the sequential estimation of ageing and date effects on growth in the RCS is identified, but remains minor. The chronology estimated using the RCS variant (regional size curve) is lower in magnitude than that estimated using the RCS, but the difference is moderate (5{\%}). These results highlight the conservative properties of the RCS with regard to the low-frequency historical signals in growth. They also suggest that singularly high estimates of growth trends reported in the dendrochronology literature are not method-dependent. We hypothesize that they may be caused by a negative site-age linkage in sampling designs. The decline reported for common beech in this temperate area of France is lower in magnitude than that evidenced in Mediterranean contexts. ?? 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

Growth trajectories of 205 individual trees from 54 neotropical species censused every 2 months over a 4-year period were used to rank 9 climate variables and find the best predictive model. • About 9{\%} of the individual variation in tree growth was imputable to the seasonal variation of climate.

Furthermore, the global annual tree growth was more dependent on the diameter increment at the onset of the rain season than on the duration of dry season. • The best predictive model included 3 climate variables: relative extractable water, minimum temperature and irradiance. The root mean squared error of prediction (0.035 mm x d(-1)) was slightly above the mean value of the growth (0.026 mm x d(-1)). • Amongst climate variables, we highlight the predominant role of water availability in determining seasonal variation in tree growth of neotropical forest trees and the need to include these relationships in forest simulators to test, in silico, the impact of different climate scenarios on the future dynamics of the rainforest.},

abstract = {Rainforests occur in high precipitation areas of eastern Australia, along a gradient in seasonality of precipitation, ranging from a summer dry season in the temperate south to a winter dry season in the tropical north. The response of net photosynthesis to increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was measured in a range of Australian rainforest trees from different latitudes to investigate possible differences in their response to atmospheric drought. Plants were grown in glasshouses under ambient or low VPD to determine the effect of growth VPD on the photosynthetic response. Temperate species, which experience low summer precipitation, were found to maintain maximum net photosynthesis over the measurement range of VPD (0.5-1.9 kPa). In contrast, the tropical species from climates with high summer precipitation showed large reductions in net photosynthesis with increasing VPD. Temperate species showed higher intrinsic water-use efficiencies under low VPD than the tropical species, whereas their efficiencies were similar under high VPD. Growing plants under a low VPD had little effect on either the photosynthetic response to VPD or the intrinsic water-use efficiency of the species. These different responses of gas exchange to VPD shown by the tropical and temperate rainforest species may reflect different strategies to maximise productivity in their respective climates.},

The average for the four subplots was 90cm2 g-1. 5. The leaf area index of grass in the clearing (blade only) averaged 0-8+0-4, and total green area index (blade+stem) averaged 1-2?0-6. Total above-ground dry biomass (blade, stem) was 2-3?0-6t ha-1, while including dead plant material gave a total dry biomass of 5-6?2-1t ha-'. Specific leaf area of the grass was 79cm2 g91. 6. The results clearly demonstrate the profound change in leaf area and biomass which accompany amazonian deforestation.},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {High-resolution analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition (??13C and ??18O) of tree-ring ??-cellulose has been increasingly in demand for the study of climate seasonality, droughts, and tropical cyclone (hurricane) activity. The peeling-grinding method commonly used for tree-ring ??-cellulose preparation is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, and often results in cross-tracheid sampling that masks high-frequency intra-annual climate signals and short-term climate events. Here, we present a new method by extracting tree-ring ??-cellulose directly from wholewood spline that omits the peeling-grinding step, and allows for micro-scale ??13C and ??18O analysis that facilitates high-resolution seasonal climate study. This ultrasound-assisted non-destructive extraction method has significantly increased the output of tree-ring ??-cellulose preparation while retaining the wood cell fabric. Wood cell-wall fibers collected from the ??-cellulose spline were directly loaded into pre-weighed silver (or tin) capsules and packed, after oven drying, for stable oxygen (or carbon) isotope analysis. A 3.045-mm annual ring subdivided over 26 sections for ??13C and ??18O analysis revealed remarkable intra-annual isotopic variations (1.62??? for ??13C, and 5.85??? for ??18O). The intra-annual ??13C values inversely covary with the seasonal precipitation pattern, suggesting moisture regulation on tree-ring ??13C variations. The high-resolution ??18O analysis unravels tropical cyclone activities (Hurricanes Frances and Ivan in 2004) that are characterized by an abrupt decline in ??18O values by 2.6??? with a "V-shape" pattern in tree-ring latewood. An algorithm is developed for establishing regional patterns of tree-ring seasonal ??13C and ??18O for the study of the mean state of climate seasonality and its anomalies. ?? 2011.},

Equations to predict increment mortality and recruitment were derived through linear regression. Enhancements proposed for the model are described and suggestions are made for modifying the model for use in other tropical mixed/moist forests.

abstract = {A collection of sepia photographs, taken during Great Britain's military expedition to Abyssinia in 1868, are the oldest landscape photographs from northern Ethiopia, and have been used to compare the status of vegetation and land management 140 years ago with that of contemporary times. Thirteen repeat landscape photographs, taken during the dry seasons of 1868 and 2008, were analyzed for various environmental indicators and show a significant improvement of vegetation cover. New eucalypt woodlands, introduced since the 1950s are visible and have provided a valuable alternative for house construction and fuel-wood, but more importantly there has also been locally important natural regeneration of indigenous trees and shrubs. The situation in respect to soil and water conservation measures in farmlands has also improved. According to both historical information and measured climatic data, rainfall conditions around 1868 and in the late 19th century were similar to those of the late 20th/early 21st century. Furthermore, despite a ten-fold increase in population density, land rehabilitation has been accomplished over extensive areas by large-scale implementation of reforestation and terracing activities, especially in the last two decades. In some cases repeat photography shows however that riparian vegetation has been washed away. This is related to river widening in recent degradation periods, particularly in the 1970s-1980s. More recently, riverbeds have become stabilized, and indicate a decreased runoff response. Environmental recovery programmes could not heal all scars, but this study shows that overall there has been a remarkable recovery of vegetation and also improved soil protection over the last 140 years, thereby invalidating hypotheses of the irreversibility of land degradation in semi-arid areas. In a highly degraded environment with high pressure on the land, rural communities were left with no alternative but to improve land husbandry: in northern Ethiopia such interventions have been demonstrably successful. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Regeneration of seven indigenous tree species having significant ecological and economic importance was investigated in the Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane forest (MSF), southern Ethiopia. Densities and distributions of seedlings, saplings and trees were assessed along gradients of altitude, light and disturbance using quadrat sizes of 10??5 m (for seedlings) and 20??20 m (saplings and trees) following line transects. The number of individuals, frequency and height of the study species were recorded in the quadrats at every 100 m drop in altitude. Seedling densities varied markedly among the species and altitudes. Mean densities (number of individuals ha-1) of seedlings ranged from zero (Polyscias fulva) to 5334 (Prunus africana), and from three (Polyscias fulva) to 102 (Podocarpus falcatus) for trees and saplings. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that seedlings of Celtis africana and Croton macrostachyus were highly favored by disturbance and, hence, were concentrated in canopy gaps within the forest. Based on their population structures, the study species could be categorized into three groups: (1) Species that showed the highest proportion of individuals in the lowest height class and with a gradual decrease towards the upper height classes, which suggests good regeneration; Podocarpus falcatus, C. africana, C. macrostachys and P. africana belonged to this group. (2) Species that showed higher proportions of individuals in the lowest height class and with missing individuals in the subsequent middle height classes, indicative of hampered regeneration; Syzygium guineense and Pouteria adolfi-friederici belonged to this group. (3) Species with no individuals in the lowest and middle height classes but represented by individuals in upper height classes; P. fulva belonged to this group. The species categorized in the last two groups exhibited hampered regeneration, and P. fulva is in the verge of local extermination. High seedling densities (e.g. C. africana and P. africana) and/or adaptive defense mechanisms to herbivory (e.g. P. falcatus and C. macrostachyus) were common attributes of species, which exhibited good regeneration. Regeneration problems were largely attributed to human disturbance, lack of suitable habitat for seed germination or problems associated to seed set (seed predation or abortion). Our study indicated that P. fulva, P. adolfi-friederici and S. guineense require the highest immediate attention for conservation in the MSF. ?? 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

If one disregards local/regional (including anthropogenic) reasons for the absence of trees, the high elevation treeline is found at surprisingly uniform growing season temperatures worldwide, while other types of thresholds (including the warmest month temperature) do not work on a global scale. This phenomenon is explained by the close aerodynamic coupling between tree crowns and atmospheric con- ditions. It is shown that the treeline position can be predicted well by thermal thresholds alone, which makes it an ideal bio- geographic reference line in modelling, for instance to estimate the global mountain forest area.},

Besides, it has also other numerous environmental, socio-economic, traditional and industrial benefits. However, the population of the species is declining at an alarming rate due to extensive human encroachment. This paper presents the importance of the species, techniques of tapping, harvesting and grading of its frankincense in Ethiopia. Moreover, the current population status of the species, its regeneration pattern and rehabilitation efforts in Tigray (northern Ethiopia) are also analyzed. Results of natural regeneration studies on closed and open areas in Tigray revealed that there is  significant (p{\textless}0.05) improvement of natural regeneration of the species in sites that are protected from both livestock and human interference. However, plantation efforts have limited success mainly due to the lack of knowledge on seed collection, nursery practices and post-planting care. It has been concluded that livestock damage poses a serious threat for the species in northern Ethiopia. In this regard, the closure of sites from grazing has become an effective way of promoting natural regeneration of B. papyrifera in northern Ethiopia},

abstract = {In a semi-deciduous natural forest stand in Cameroon a forest inventory and increment estimations on all trees with a diameter above 10cm were carried out in an area of 1ha. The stand is dominated by Triplochiton scleroxylon and is a part of a forest type which is widely distributed in West Africa. The existence of annual rings in the wood of trees was proven by radiocarbon dating and tree ring analysis. The oldest tree (Celtis zenkeri) of the stand was 220 years old. The age class between 41 and 60 years is the strongest in number of individuals. Trees with an age of more than 120 years were found exclusively in the storey of the emergents. The age of the trees correlates very weakly with the diameter and the height. The mean diameter growth rates vary between 0.2cm per year in understorey tree species and 0.82cm per year in emergent species. The major timber species (T. scleroxylon) reaches in mean the minimum felling diameter of 80cm within 90 years. According to their age and height distribution together with the wood density, we distinguished three major types of life strategies of species cohorts. Species with high wood density and low increment rates in all age classes are generally restricted to the understorey. Species with exclusively old individuals, low or moderate wood densities and high increment rates are restricted to the upper storey and can be classified as long-living pioneers (T. scleroxylon). Finally, species with moderate or high wood density, some old individuals in the upper storey and many recruits in the lower canopy can be defined as mature forest trees or trees of the future (Nesogordonia papaverifera, Sterculia rhinopetala). These findings lead to the assumption that the investigated stand can be classified as a very late secondary stand in transition to a mature forest.},

abstract = {A general mean annual temperature increase accompanied with substantial glacial retreat has been noted on the Tibetan Plateau during the last two centuries but most significantly since the mid 1950s. These climate trends are particularly apparent on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. However, the Tibetan Plateau (due to its heterogeneous mountain landscape) has very complex and spatially differing temperature and precipitations patterns. As a result, intensive palaeolimnological investigations are necessary to decipher these climatic patterns and to understand ecological responses to recent environmental change. Here we present palaeolimnological results from a (210)Pb/(137)Cs-dated sediment core spanning approximately the last 200 years from a remote high-mountain lake (LC6 Lake, working name) on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Sediment profiles of diatoms, organic variables (TOC, C:N) and grain size were investigated. The (210)Pb record suggests a period of rapid sedimentation, which might be linked to major tectonic events in the region ca. 1950. Furthermore, unusually high (210)Pb supply rates over the last 50 years suggest that the lake has possibly been subjected to increasing precipitation rates, sediment focussing and/or increased spring thaw. The majority of diatom taxa encountered in the core are typical of slightly acidic to circumneutral, oligotrophic, electrolyte-poor lakes. Diatom species assemblages were rich, and dominated by Cyclotella sp., Achnanthes sp., Aulacoseira sp. and fragilarioid taxa. Diatom compositional change was minimal over the 200-year period (DCCA = 0.85 SD, p = 0.59); only a slightly more diverse but unstable diatom assemblage was recorded during the past 50 years. The results indicate that large-scale environmental changes recorded in the twentieth century (i.e. increased precipitation and temperatures) are likely having an affect on the LC6 Lake, but so far these impacts are more apparent on the lake geochemistry than on the diatom flora. Local and/or regional peculiarities, such as increasing precipitation and cloud cover, or localized climatic phenomena, such as negative climate feedbacks, might have offset the effects of increasing mean surface temperatures.},

abstract = {We present here the 2001-2004 results of observational field studies aimed at quantifying tropical timberline climate and radial increment of Pinus hartwegii Lindl. trees on Nevado de Colima, in the middle of the North American Monsoon region. An automated weather station was installed at 3760 m a.s.l., 19{\&}DEG; 34.778'N latitude, 103{\&}DEG; 37.180'W longitude, within a forest where multi-century tree-ring records had been previously developed. At the same time, automated electronic sensors for recording tree growth at 30-min intervals were set up at two sites within a 1-km radius from the weather station. Meteorological observations recorded every 30 min were summarized on a daily basis. Time-series patterns are reported for atmospheric pressure, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and wind speed and direction. Of particular interest is the sudden decrease in air temperature after the onset of the monsoon season, which determines very high relative humidity over the summer and results in air temperature having a spring maximum. Despite sub-freezing air temperatures in most months, soil temperatures never drop below 0{\&}DEG; C. Dendrometer data show that the timberline growing season begins in March-April as temperature increases, then radial growth continues throughout the cool-wet summer monsoon, and ends in October-November. As an unexpected result, it was also possible to measure the progressive decline of Pinus hartwegii stem increment in response to an outbreak of roundheaded pine beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford), which ultimately killed most trees at one of our two experimental sites.},

abstract = {A comparison of the tree-ring width of pines growing in areas adjacent to a peat bog and on a Baltic raised bog dome suggests that cambium activity in each tree group is affected by different factors. The study was aimed at pinpointing effects of meteorological factors on two pine populations growing under different hydrological conditions. The study further sought to identify periods during which anthropogenic pressure affected the two populations. The pines growing on mineral soil were characterised by ring-width growth-climate responses typical of this part of Europe, whereas the tree-ring growth of the pines growing on the peat bog showed no unequivocal relationship with meteorological conditions. The tree-ring width growth dynamics of that population responded primarily to changes in the level of the groundwater table. These changes were associated with human activities over the last two centuries. The development of the tree stands on the peat bog and in its immediate vicinity was reconstructed using this assumption and available historical evidence. A banding drainage ditch dug around 1880 resulted in the drying of the peat bog, the introduction of pines, and the forestation of the bog. Digging of central ditches (in the 1960s) resulted in periodic desiccation of the bog surface and reduction of the tree-ring widths; similar responses were observed in the 1980s as a consequence of the deepening and opening of the drainage ditches. The recent years are characterised by decreasing ring-width growth as a result of the damming of drainage ditches. Damming resulted in an increase of the groundwater table level in the bog and in a partial inundation of tree roots. This partial inundation interfered with gas exchange and adversely affected the health status of the pines studied. Our results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding peat bog palaeohydrology and facilitate absolute dating of changes associated with anthropogenic transformations. In active nature protection, such data are of key importance for understanding the functioning of a peatland and for planning active conservation measures. ?? 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Fog is a seasonally variable hydrologic input to coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens, D. Don) ecosystems with a stable isotopic composition ($\delta$ 18O, $\delta$2H) that is distinct from rainfall. The intra-annual variation in tree ring cellulose $\delta$18O of coast redwood was measured to determine what portion of the tree ring should be sampled to best target fog signals. Ten years of rings were subdivided into ten equal units for three trees at two sites in northern California. Intra-annual variation in cellulose $\delta$18O was as high as 3‰ with a consistent pattern of enriched (in 18O) values from the annual ring boundary and depleted values from the central portion of the ring. These patterns show a strong coherence between replicate trees at the same site as well as significant correlations between individuals at sites over 250 km apart. Intra-annual variation in stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C) was as high as 2‰ and produced a pattern with depleted (in 13C) values from the ring boundary and enriched values from the central portion of the ring. Although these $\delta$13C patterns were not as strongly correlated between replicate trees as the patterns in $\delta$18O variation, they did produce significant correlations with the variation in fog frequencies recorded at local airports. This study highlights the importance of quantifying intra-annual variation in tree ring stable isotope signals as a guide to further investigations on historic variability from long chronologies especially if the signal of interest is seasonally variable (eg, fog).},

In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity2–5 . So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change6 . Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth7 , we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

abstract = {Regeneration of seven indigenous tree species having significant ecological and economic importance was investigated in the Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane forest (MSF), southern Ethiopia. Densities and distributions of seedlings, saplings and trees were assessed along gradients of altitude, light and disturbance using quadrat sizes of 10??5 m (for seedlings) and 20??20 m (saplings and trees) following line transects. The number of individuals, frequency and height of the study species were recorded in the quadrats at every 100 m drop in altitude. Seedling densities varied markedly among the species and altitudes. Mean densities (number of individuals ha-1) of seedlings ranged from zero (Polyscias fulva) to 5334 (Prunus africana), and from three (Polyscias fulva) to 102 (Podocarpus falcatus) for trees and saplings. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that seedlings of Celtis africana and Croton macrostachyus were highly favored by disturbance and, hence, were concentrated in canopy gaps within the forest. Based on their population structures, the study species could be categorized into three groups: (1) Species that showed the highest proportion of individuals in the lowest height class and with a gradual decrease towards the upper height classes, which suggests good regeneration; Podocarpus falcatus, C. africana, C. macrostachys and P. africana belonged to this group. (2) Species that showed higher proportions of individuals in the lowest height class and with missing individuals in the subsequent middle height classes, indicative of hampered regeneration; Syzygium guineense and Pouteria adolfi-friederici belonged to this group. (3) Species with no individuals in the lowest and middle height classes but represented by individuals in upper height classes; P. fulva belonged to this group. The species categorized in the last two groups exhibited hampered regeneration, and P. fulva is in the verge of local extermination. High seedling densities (e.g. C. africana and P. africana) and/or adaptive defense mechanisms to herbivory (e.g. P. falcatus and C. macrostachyus) were common attributes of species, which exhibited good regeneration. Regeneration problems were largely attributed to human disturbance, lack of suitable habitat for seed germination or problems associated to seed set (seed predation or abortion). Our study indicated that P. fulva, P. adolfi-friederici and S. guineense require the highest immediate attention for conservation in the MSF. ?? 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Foresters have traditionally managed forests with silvicultural systems that prescribe stand homogeneity for optimized tree growth. The primacy of timber as the dominant objective is giving way to broader objectives such as sustaining the function and dynamics of ecosystems, maintaining ecosystem diversity and resilience or protecting sensitive species, while providing for a variety of ecosystem services of value to humanity. Protection and production of more diverse forest values demands consideration of the fine-scale variability found within forest stands and an understanding of the spatial and temporal response of forest ecosystems to manipulation. Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been used little by foresters for predicting ecosystem response to partial cutting. We review the gap dynamics literature paying special attention to papers that use gap size or position as predictive variables for responses indicative of silvicultural success or maintenance of ecosystem function. Like canopy gaps created by natural tree death or windthrow, gaps are also generated by silvicultural systems which remove dominant trees. Results from the Date Creek silvicultural systems study in northwestern British Columbia presented here demonstrate the utility of a gap-based approach for understanding ecosystem responds to tree cutting. We propose a gap-based approach for study of stand response to silvicultural manipulation that: (1) aids development of cutting prescriptions that maintain functional mature or old-growth conditions; (2) refines and extends our understanding of how biological structures, organisms and ecosystem processes are affected by fine-scale variation within stands; and (3) leads to development of novel silvicultural systems that meet timber production objectives without compromising ecosystem management principles.},

abstract = {The fixation of carbon in tropical forests mainly occurs through the production of wood and leaves, both be- ing the principal components of net primary production. Cur- rently field and satellite observations are independently used to describe the forest carbon cycle, but the link between satellite-derived forest phenology and field-derived forest productivity remains opaque. We used a unique combina- tion of a MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) dataset, a wood production model based on climate data and di- rect litterfall observations at an intra-annual timescale in order to question the synchronism of leaf and wood pro- duction in tropical forests. Even though leaf and wood biomass fluxes had the same range (respectively 2.4±1.4 and 2.2±0.4MgCha−1 yr−1), they occurred separately in time. EVI increased with leaf renewal at the beginning of the dry season, when solar irradiance was at its maximum. At this time, wood production stopped. At the onset of the rainy season, when new leaves were fully mature and water avail- able again, wood production quickly increased to reach its maximum in less than a month, reflecting a change in carbon allocation from short-lived pools (leaves) to long-lived pools (wood). The time lag between peaks of EVI and wood pro- duction (109 days) revealed a substantial decoupling between the leaf renewal assumed to be driven by irradiance and the water-driven wood production. Our work is a first attempt to link EVI data, wood production and leaf phenology at a sea- sonal timescale in a tropical evergreen rainforest and pave the way to develop more sophisticated global carbon cycle models in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Airborne laser scanning provides continuous coverage mapping of forest canopy height and thereby is a powerful tool to scale-up above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates from stand to landscape. A critical first step is the selection of the plot variables which can be related to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) statistics. A universal approach was previously proposed which combines local and regional estimates of basal area (BA) and wood density with LiDAR-derived canopy height to map carbon at a regional scale (Asner et al. in Oecologia 168:1147-1160, 2012). Here we explore the contribution of stem diameter distribution, specific wood density and height-diameter (H-D) allometry to forest stand AGB and propose an alternative model. By applying the new model to a large tropical forest data set we show that an appropriate choice of input variables is essential to minimize prediction error of stand AGB which will propagate at larger scale. Stem number (N) and average stem cross-sectional area should be used instead of BA when scaling from tree to plot. Stand quadratic mean diameter above the census threshold diameter size should be preferred over stand mean diameter as it reduces the prediction error of stand AGB by a factor of ten. Wood density should be weighted by stem volume per species instead of BA. LiDAR-derived statistics should prove useful for estimating local H-D allometries as well as mapping N and the mean quadratic diameter above 10 cm at the landscape level. Prior stratification into forest types is likely to improve both estimation procedures significantly and is considered the foremost current challenge.},

abstract = {. There is still much uncertainty about ecological controls on the rate and direction of net CO2 exchange by tropical rain forests, in spite of their importance to global C cycling. These controls are thought to arise from hydrologie and nutrient constraints to CO2 fixation caused by seasonality of precipitation and adverse chemical properties of some major tropical soil types. Using the ecosystem model e cosy s , we show that water uptake to a depth of 8 m avoids constraints to CO2 and energy exchange from soil drying during five-month dry seasons typical for eastern Amazonian forests. This avoidance in the model was tested with eddy co variance (EC) measurements of CO2 and energy fluxes during 2003 and 2004 over an old-growth forest on an acidic, nutrient-poor oxisol in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest (TNF) in Par{\'{a}}, Brazil. Modeled CO2 fixation was strongly constrained by slow phosphorus (P) uptake caused by low soil pH. Daytime CO2 influxes in the model were in close agreement with EC measurements (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8) during both wet and dry seasons. Both modeled and measured fluxes indicated that seasonality of precipitation affected CO2 and energy exchange more through its effect on radiation and air temperature on soil water than content. When aggregated to a yearly scale, modeled and gap-filled EC CO2 fluxes indicated that old-growth forest stands in the TNF remained within 100 g CnT{\^{}}yr"1 of C neutrality in the absence of major disturbance. Annual C transformations in ecosys were further corroborated by extensive biometrie measurements taken in the TNF and elsewhere in the Amazon basin, which also indicated that old-growth forests were either small C sources or small C sinks. Long-term model runs suggested that rain forests could be substantial C sinks for several decades while regenerating stand-replacing after disturbances, but would gradually decline toward C neutrality thereafter. The time course of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the model depended upon annual rates of herbivory and tree mortality, which were based on site observations as affected by weather (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation [ENSO] events). This dependence suggests that rain forest NEP is strongly controlled by disturbance as well as by weather.},

abstract = {In this paper a new model for simulation of the growth of tropical rain forest is presented (FORMIX3). The model describes growth, mortality, recruitment of trees and competition between trees. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. The carbon gain of a tree depends on the photo production of its leaves, respiration and other losses. Trees compete for light and space. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Based on an extensive field data review, a parametrisation was developed for the simulation of lowland Dipterocarp rain forest at Deramakot, Malaysia. A total of 28 variables describing different aspects of forest structure and growth were compared with field data. The model reproduces most parts of the forest dynamics well. A new concept for sensitivity analysis is presented: 46 Model parameter were varied and analysed in respect to their influence on 26 variables describing the forest state. The influence of the different processes on forest structure is complex. Some general trends can be observed: The growth characteristics of the two Dipterocarp species groups strongly influences species composition in the forest, but not general forest structure (biomass, leaf area, production, leaf area, tree size distribution) (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are global centres of biodiversity and carbon storage. Many tropical countries aspire to protect forest to fulfil biodiversity and climate mitigation policy targets, but the conservation strategies needed to achieve these two functions depend critically on the tropical forest tree diversity-carbon storage relationship. Assessing this relationship is challenging due to the scarcity of inventories where carbon stocks in aboveground biomass and species identifications have been simultaneously and robustly quantified. Here, we compile a unique pan-tropical dataset of 360 plots located in structurally intact old-growth closed-canopy forest, surveyed using standardised methods, allowing a multi-scale evaluation of diversity-carbon relationships in tropical forests. Diversity-carbon relationships among all plots at 1 ha scale across the tropics are absent, and within continents are either weak (Asia) or absent (Amazonia, Africa). A weak positive relationship is detectable within 1 ha plots, indicating that diversity effects in tropical forests may be scale dependent. The absence of clear diversity-carbon relationships at scales relevant to conservation planning means that carbon-centred conservation strategies will inevitably miss many high diversity ecosystems. As tropical forests can have any combination of tree diversity and carbon stocks both require explicit consideration when optimising policies to manage tropical carbon and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Dynamic vegetation models provide process-based explanations of the dynamics and the distribution of plant ecosystems. They offer significant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But field data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difficult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy flux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientific progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice.},

abstract = {Climate change effects on growth rates of tropical trees may lead to alterations in carbon cycling of carbon-rich tropical forests. However, climate sensitivity of broad-leaved lowland tropical trees is poorly understood. Dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) provides a powerful tool to study the relationship between tropical tree growth and annual climate variability. We aimed to establish climate-growth relationships for five annual-ring forming tree species, using ring-width data from 459 canopy and understory trees from a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand. Based on 183/459 trees, chronologies with total lengths between 29 and 62 years were produced for four out of five species. Bootstrapped correlation analysis revealed that climate-growth responses were similar among these four species. Growth was significantly negatively correlated with current-year maximum and minimum temperatures, and positively correlated with dry-season precipitation levels. Negative correlations between growth and temperature may be attributed to a positive relationship between temperature and autotrophic respiration rates. The positive relationship between growth and dry-season precipitation levels likely reflects the strong water demand during leaf flush. Mixed-effect models yielded results that were consistent across species: a negative effect of current wet-season maximum temperatures on growth, but also additive positive effects of, for example, prior dry-season maximum temperatures. Our analyses showed that annual growth variability in tropical trees is determined by a combination of both temperature and precipitation variability. With rising temperature, the predominantly negative relationship between temperature and growth may imply decreasing growth rates of tropical trees as a result of global warming.},

abstract = {Long-term climate–growth relationships, were examined in tree rings of four co-occurring tree species from semi-arid Acacia savanna woodlands in Ethiopia. The main purpose of the study was to prove the presence of annual tree rings, evaluate the relationship between radial growth and climate parameters, and evaluate the associa- tion of El Nin ˜o and drought years in Ethiopia. The results showed that all species studied form distinct growth boundaries, though differences in distinctiveness were revealed among the species. Tree rings of the evergreen Balanites aegyptiaca were separated by vessels surround- ing a thin parenchyma band and the growth boundary of the deciduous acacias was characterized by thin parenchyma bands. The mean annual diameter increment ranged from 3.6 to 5.0 mm. Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal showed more enhanced growth than Acacia tortilis and B. aegyp- tiaca. High positive correlations were found between the tree-ring width chronologies and precipitation data, and all species showed similar response to external climate forc- ing, which supports the formation of one tree-ring per year. Strong declines in tree-ring width correlated remarkably well with past El Nin ˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and drought/famine periods in Ethiopia. Spectral analysis of the master tree-ring chronology indicated occurrences of periodic drought events, which fall within the spectral peak equivalent to 2–8 years. Our results proved the strong linkage between tree-ring chronologies and climate, which sheds light on the potential of dendrochronological studies developing in Ethiopia. The outcome of this study has important implications for paleoclimatic reconstructions and in restoration of degraded lands.},

abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter (QSD, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as QSD increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the FAO to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to FAO data results in a 28 to 47{\%} increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data.},

abstract = {Tree rings of Pinus pinaster often contain intra- annual density fluctuations (IADFs), which have been attributed to the succession of dry and rainy periods typical of Mediterranean climate, but their formation has not been studied yet under Atlantic climate. We analyzed the occurrence and climatic significance of replicated IADFs in ten monospecific stands in NW Spain. The frequency of IADFs was higher than previously reported for this species under Mediterranean conditions and consistently decreased with increasing elevation. The formation of bands of late- wood-like tracheids within the earlywood was favored by dry previous August, cold previous winter and dry April. Bands of earlywood-like tracheids within the early late- wood were also favored by low winter temperatures. However, their occurrence was geographically heteroge- neous, with two groups of stands being defined by their distances to the shoreline. In coastal stands, cold May– August triggered IADFs formation, while in inland stands their formation was favored by dry May–July. Regional winter temperatures and April water balance were strongly related to the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, which greatly conditioned the occurrence of IADFs in the earlywood and the early latewood. By contrast, the presence of bands of earlywood-like tracheids in the late latewood was inde- pendent of the EA pattern, being strongly related to warm conditions in spring and especially to a wet October. The link between regional climate and the EA pattern strongly controlled the physiological processes that determine intra- annual growth dynamics and short-term cell enlargement of P. pinaster in NW Spain.},

Our study site (10°N) is climatically influenced by both summer (June—August) and spring (March—May) rainfall caused by the annual movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and modulated by large-scale anomalies in the atmospheric circulation and in ocean temperatures. Here we show that stalagmite growth, episodic throughout the last 7800 years, demonstrates decadal-scale (8—25 yr) variability in both growth rate and $\delta$ 18O. A hydrological model was employed and indicates that this decadal variability is due to variations in the relative amounts of rainfall in the two rain seasons. Our record, unique in its combination of length (a total of {\~{}}1000 years), annual chronology and high resolution $\delta$18O, shows for the first time that such decadal-scale variability in rainfall in this region has occurred through the Holocene, which implies persistent decadal-scale variability for the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic driving factors.},

abstract = {Studies of intra-annual dynamics of cambial activity and wood formation share very similar data because they are based on classic concepts of xylem development and well-documented techniques of sample preparation. However, the way the data are produced is specific to each study or group of authors because there is not a real agreement or consensus about critical variable definitions and data processing. The consequence is that despite very similar data, these studies are difficult to compare. In order to improve this point, we proposed objective definitions of the main phenological events (critical dates) occurring during wood formation, i.e. the beginning and ending of the cell enlarging and maturing phases and the beginning of the cell mature phase. The beginning of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50{\%} of the observed radial files show at least one first cell in this phase, while the end of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50{\%} of the observed radial files show at most one last cell in this phase. Dedicated R package CAVIAR was developed in order to apply these definitions to the computation of critical dates, as well as to their visualisation and analysis. Several statistical tests (Student's t-test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and bootstrap tests on means and medians) were evaluated for comparing critical dates between two groups. Based on theoretical considerations and on study case analyses, it was shown that the bootstrap test on median is the best-suited statistical test for comparing critical dates when considering the peculiarities of the data at hand. Finally, the application of the presented definitions and methods was illustrated by the study of a real dataset obtained from five silver firs and five Scots pines grown under the same conditions and sampled weekly during the 2006 vegetation period. The results of this application showed that wood formation in pines started earlier, finished later and lasted longer than in firs, as documented by previous studies. We believe that the development of such objective definitions accompanied by ready-to-use tools for data processing, analysis and visualisation will reinforce the discipline by contributing efficiently to standardise concepts and methodologies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of species that basically depend on the same resources has been a brainteaser for generations of ecologists. Different mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate coexistence in plant communities, where space is an important resource. Using a stochastic cellular automaton simulation model we analyze - separately and in combination - the influence of different species traits and processes which alter local competition on the coexistence of plant species over a fixed time horizon. We show that different species traits operate on different time scales in competition. We therefore suggest the concept of weak versus strong traits according to short- or long-term exclusion of species differing in these traits. As a consequence, highly non-linear trade-offs between weak and strong traits can result in communities. Furthermore, we found that trade-offs based on physiological species traits such as plant lifetime, dispersal range and plant growth, did not support broad and long-term coexistence-further processes such as density-dependent mortality and light-dependent colonization were necessary. This suggests that coexistence in plant communities requires (stabilizing) local processes to support the (equalizing) trade-offs in species traits. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest degradation is a major issue for policy-makers that is exacerbated by no clear and globally accepted definition of the term. For forest managers, a loss of forest productive capacity is one form of forest degradation. We present a quantitative method to assess forest degradation from a productivity perspective. Our method uses a standard stocking chart and calculation methods based on standard forest inventory data, to derive a clear threshold value for stocking, below which a forest should be considered degraded. The method is illustrated using the example of a self-regenerating Nothofagus production forest type from Chile. For that forest type, we determined that harvesting trees to below a specific basal area relative to site type, resulted in a loss of resilience, an unpredictable shift in ecosystem state, and a degraded condition. Our method illustrates how over-harvesting can degrade the long-term productivity of a stand and forest resilience. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that forests can also be degraded from other perspectives, such as loss of biodiversity, carbon, or protective functions as a result of excessive disturbances. Ecosystem management requires that managers consider degradation from a range of perspectives. We see the quantified approach used here as a way to provide practitioners with, in part, a transition from sustained yield to ecosystem management with an ultimate objective of providing a pathway towards adaptive management of complex systems and avoiding degradation.},

abstract = {This article deals with the question of how the being ‘tree' can be understood in such a way that evidence can emerge which, for instance, makes it possible to recognise the ecological niche of the European mistletoe (Vis- cum album), a plant that could not exist on earth without its particular living host tree. Although trees are plants, they differ from herbaceous plants in many ways. Not only can trees live to great ages compared with other organisms, but also they actively create mountain-like, concrete spaces. From this point of view, the sim- ilarity between trees and minerals becomes evident. Therefore, in contrast to herbaceous plants, trees lose their ability to produce impressive flowers. Conifers can be regarded as the most mineral-like group among trees. This article primarily covers the form of the conifer and its variability as well as attempting to achieve a natu- ral systematology of the conifers using a phenomenological approach. Single conifer species, especially the two mistletoe hosts pine (Pinus sylvestris) and fir (Abies alba), are judged essentially according to their unique ex- pression. This can help towards revealing their curative power.},

abstract = {Classifying species by shared life-history traits is important if common ecological response groups are to be identified among different species. We investigated how habitat area, local and regional factors shape plant communities in small isolated closed depressions, and how the species richness is related to the interplay between environmental factors and specific life-history trait combinations. In Central-Western Europe, 169 closed depressions were completely surveyed for plant presence in two highly contrasted landscapes (forested and open landscapes). All species were clustered into 9 Emergent Groups based on 10 life-history traits related to plant dispersal, establishment and persistence. Habitat areas were related to species presence using logistic regressions. Most Emergent Groups were more area-dependent in open than in forested landscapes, owing to heterogeneous light levels in forest weakening the species-area relationship. In open landscapes, Floating Hydrophytes were severely underrepresented in very small depressions, owing to the absence of waterfowl population. Local environmental and regional factors were related to species richness using Generalized Linear Models. In open landscapes, local environmental factors such as water conductivity or soil productivity are respectively the main predictors. In forested landscapes, the abundance of most Emergent Groups was better predicted by regional factors, i.e., habitat connectivity and distance to the forest edge. Forested landscapes strongly impeded the closed depressions' colonization by the less mobile Emergent Groups such as Large-seeded Perennials. ?? 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to cli- mate and resource gradients, coupledwith disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and air- borne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosys- tem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest dis- tribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite in- creasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also ap- parently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Although studies on stable-carbon isotopes in trees from temperate zones provide abundant paleoclimatic data, tropical trees are still understudied in this context. Therefore this study examined the variability of intra- and inter-annual stable-carbon isotopic pattern in several tree species from various tropical climates. The delta C-13 Values of samples of 12 broadleaved trees (seven species) from various paleotropical and neotropical sites along a climatic moisture gradient were investigated. The inter-annual variability between species and sites was studied. Further the relationship between delta C-13 and precipitation time series was analyzed. Results show that tropical tree species show a similar variability in carbon isotopic composition as temperate tree species. Significant correlations between annual precipitation and tree-ring delta C-13 time series were negative. Successful crossdating of a tree-ring delta C-13 time series highlights the potential of carbon isotope measurements for tropical tree-ring analytical studies. Tropical broadleaved trees are able to capture a carbon isotopic signal in their annual rings even under everwet conditions and show good potential for paleoclimatic research.},

abstract = {Tree mortality in tropical forests is a complex ecological process for which modelling approaches need to be improved to better understand, and then predict, the evolution of tree mortality in response to global change. The mortality model introduced here computes an individual probability of dying for each tree in a community. The mortality model uses the ontogenetic stage of the tree because youngest and oldest trees are more likely to die. Functional traits are integrated as proxies of the ecological strategies of the trees to permit generalization among all species in the community. Data used to parametrize the model were collected at Paracou study site, a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, where 20,408 trees have been censused for 18 years. A Bayesian framework was used to select useful covariates and to estimate the model parameters. This framework was developed to deal with sources of uncertainty, including the complexity of the mortality process itself and the field data, especially historical data for which taxonomic determinations were uncertain. Uncertainty about the functional traits was also considered, to maximize the information they contain. Four functional traits were strong predictors of tree mortality: wood density, maximum height, laminar toughness and stem and branch orientation, which together distinguished the light-demanding, fast-growing trees from slow-growing trees with lower mortality rates. Our modelling approach formalizes a complex ecological problem and offers a relevant mathematical framework for tropical ecologists to process similar uncertain data at the community level.},

abstract = {Ring-width and maximum latewood density data from a network of high-elevation sites distributed across the European Alps are used to reconstruct regional temperatures. The network integrates 53 ring-width and 31 density chronologies from stands of four species all located above 1500 m a.s.l. The development and basic climatic response patterns of this network are described elsewhere (Frank and Esper, 2005). The common temperature signal over the study region allowed regional reconstructions to be developed using principal component regression models for average June–August (1600–1988) and April–September (1650–1987) temperatures from ring-width and density records, respectively. Similar climatic histories are derived for both seasons, but with the ring-width and density-based reconstructions seemingly weighted toward carrying more of their variance in the lower and higher frequency domains, respectively. Distinct warm decades are the 1940s, 1860s, 1800s, 1730s, 1660s and the 1610s, and cold decades, the 1910s, 1810s, 1710s, 1700s and the 1690s. Because of the model fitting and the shorter time spans involved, comparisons between the reconstructions with high-elevation instrumental data during the majority of the 1864–1972 calibration period show good agreement. Yet, prior to this period, from which only a few low elevation temperature records are available, a trend divergence between tree-ring and instrumental records is observed. We present evidence that this divergence may be explained by the ring-width data carrying more of an annual rather than warm-season signal in the lower frequency domain. Other factors such as noise, tree-ring standardization, or the more uncertain nature of low-frequency trends in early instrumental records and their homogenization, might help explain this divergence as well.},

They are commonly applied in the United States but they are rarely used in European forest management yet. One of the few exceptions is the simulator SILVA, which is presented in this paper. The underlying equations of this simulator are developed from a set of more than 155,000 tree observations, including the species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.). These basic model equations are presented together with respective parameter values, derived from the aforesaid data set. The benefits of SILVA for forest practice, research, and education are demonstrated with three exemplary applications. Evaluation in terms of biological plausibility, validation, and practical use of the implemented software is presented, which shows that: (1) biological principles could be represented without explicitly being implemented, and (2) the simulation results are very close to independent observations as far as the range of parameterized site conditions is not exceeded. Furthermore, possible implications of changing conditions or an application of the model across a wider geographical range are discussed with special reference to the ongoing process of parameterization. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Extensive collections have been made from trees in the Southern Hemisphere as part of a study to reconstruct past climate from variations in the width of annual growth rings. In connection with this work, cores and discs from 20 New Zealand tree species were collected from 45 sites throughout the North and South Islands. The potential for dendro- chronological analysis was assessed for each species, and extensive collections were made of those considered most promising. Libocedrus bidwillii, Phyllocladus trichomanoides, and P. glaucus were used to produce climatically sensitive, dated chronologies in excess of 500 years long. Dacrydium biforme and D. colensoi tend to have less year-to-year variability in growth, but also yield long chronolo- gies in some areas. Phyllocladus alpinus and Agathis australis frequently have pronounced lobate growth, and are datable only at some sites. Twenty chronologies were developed using these 7 species. It is suggested that future dendrochronological studies may be successful with other species, and that the genera Dacrydium, Podocarpus, and Nothofagus offer most potential.},

abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90{\%} of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

abstract = {{\&} Key message We review the recent findings on the influ-ence of drought on tree mortality, growth or ecosystem functioning in tropical rainforests. Drought plays a major role in shaping tropical rainforests and the response mech-anisms are highly diverse and complex. The numerous gaps identified here require the international scientific community to combine efforts in order to conduct com-prehensive studies in tropical rainforests on the three con-tinents. These results are essential to simulate the future of these ecosystems under diverse climate scenarios and to predict the future of the global earth carbon balance. {\&} Context Tropical rainforest ecosystems are characterized by high annual rainfall. Nevertheless, rainfall regularly fluctuates during the year and seasonal soil droughts do occur. Over the past decades, a number of extreme droughts have hit tropical rainforests, not only in Amazonia but also in Asia and Africa. The influence of drought events on tree mortality and growth or on ecosystem functioning (carbon and water fluxes) in tropical rainforest ecosystems has been studied intensively, but the response mechanisms are complex. {\&} Aims Herein, we review the recent findings related to the response of tropical forest ecosystems to seasonal and extreme droughts and the current knowledge about the future of these ecosystems. {\&} Results This review emphasizes the progress made over recent years and the importance of the studies conducted un-der extreme drought conditions or in through-fall exclusion experiments in understanding the response of these ecosys-tems. It also points to the great diversity and complexity of the response of tropical rainforest ecosystems to drought. {\&} Conclusion The numerous gaps identified here require the international scientific community to combine efforts in order to conduct comprehensive studies in tropical forest regions. These results are essential to simulate the future of these eco-systems under diverse climate scenarios and to predict the future of the global earth carbon balance.},

abstract = {A mechanistic model is presented to quantify both the physical and biochemical fractionation events associated with hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose. The model predicts the isotope ratios of tree-rings, incorporating both humidity and source water environmental information. Components of the model include (1) hydrogen and oxygen isotope effects associated with leaf water enrichment; (2) incorporation of leaf water isotope ratio values into photosynthetic carbohydrates along with the biochemical fractionation associated with autotrophic synthesis; (3) transport of exported carbohydrates (such as sucrose) from leaves to developing xylem in shoots and stems where cellulose is formed; (4) a partial exchange of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in carbohydrates with xylem sap water during conversion into cellulose; and (5) a biochemical fractionation associated with cellulose synthesis. A modified version of the Craig-Gordon model for evaporative enrichment adequately described leaf water ??D and ??18O values. The leaf water model was robust over a wide range of leaf waters for both controlled experiments and field studies, far exceeding the range of values to be expected under natural conditions. The isotopic composition of cellulose was modeled using heterotrophic and autotrophic fractionation factors from the literature as well as the experimentally derived proportions of H and O that undergo exchange with xylem water during cellulose synthesis in xylem cells of tree-rings. The fraction of H and O from carbohydrates that exchange with xylem sap water was estimated to be 0.36 and 0.42, respectively. The proportions based on controlled, long-term greenhouse experiments and field studies where the variations in the ??D and ??18O of tree-ring cellulose were measured under different source water isotopic compositions. The model prediction that tree-ring cellulose contains information on environmental water source and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (related to relative humidity) was tested under both field and greenhouse conditions. This model was compared to existing models to explain cellulose isotope ratios under a wide range of source water and humidity conditions. Predictions from our model were consistent with observations, whereas other models showed large discrepancies as soon as the isotope ratios of source water and atmospheric water deviated from each other. Our model resolves the apparently conflicting and disparate interpretations of several previous cellulose stable isotope ratio studies. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Lowland evergreen rainforests in southern Chile growing on highly productive soils and accessible sites have been subjected to traditional and industrial logging of valuable timber trees. Old-growth rain forests in this area are characterized by highly conservative N cycles, which results in an efficient N use of ecosystems. We hypothesize that different logging practices, by changing forest structure and species composition, can alter the quantity and quality (i.e. C/N ratio) of litterfall and soil organic matter and soil microbial processes that determine N storage and availability. To test this hypothesis we investigated chemical properties, microbial N transformations, N fluxes and N storage in soils of lowland evergreen rainforests of Chilo{\'{e}} Island after 10 years since industrial selective logging (ISL) and in stands subjected to traditional selective logging (TSL) by landowners in small properties. We compared them to reference unlogged old-growth stands (OG) in the same area. Tree basal area was more reduced in the stands subjected to ISL than to TSL. Litterfall inputs were similar in both logging treatments as in OG stands. This was due to greater biomass of understory species after logging. In TSL understory tree species determined a higher litterfall C/N ratio than ISL. We found higher soil N availability and content of base cations in surface soils of logged forests than in OG. The litter horizon of OG forest had significantly higher rates of non-symbiotic N fixation than logged forests. In the ISL treatment there was a trend toward increasing soil denitrification and significantly higher NO3-N/Nt ratio in spring waters, which led to a stronger $\delta$15N signal in surface and deep soils. We conclude that massive understory occupation by the shade-intolerant native bamboo Chusquea quila in ISL led to enhanced litter quality (lower C/N ratios) relaxing the tightness of the N cycle, which increased soil N availability leading to a higher proportion of nitrate in spring waters and higher gaseous N losses. In contrast, under TSL a higher litterfall C/N ratio slowed decomposition and net N mineralization rates thus reducing the chances for N losses, and enhancing C and N storage in soil. We suggest that sustainable logging practices in these rain forests should be based on lower rates of canopy removal to enhance colonization of the understory by shade-tolerant trees, which are associated with a more efficient N cycle. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, people have tried to establish and manage protected areas on a one-sided basis, often exclusively from the natural sciences. On the other hand, the population directly affected by the establishment of a protected area has not been involved in planning or management and not been compensated for any losses. We call for an integrated approach to research, with biologists and ecologists as well as social scientists and economists working together on a feasible conservation concept. The political framework needs to be taken into account but even more important is getting the local population involved in every step of the planning process and compensating them for the loss of utilization rights and resources.},

Residual chronologies of tree-ring width and maximum latewood density were developed for the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits, and were compared with monthly mean temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation. Tree-ring widths of the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits positively correlated with temperatures during the beginning of the dormant season and during the growing season of the current year, except for A. veitchii at the lower distribution limit, which showed no positive correlation with temperature. Maximum latewood densities of the two Abies species at the upper and lower distribution limits positively and negatively correlated with temperatures and precipitation, respectively, during the growing season of the current year. Therefore, tree-ring widths and maximum latewood densities of the two Abies species were sensitive to low temperature, except for the tree-ring width of A. veitchii at the lower distribution limit with the warmest thermal conditions along the altitude. Global warming is suggested to affect maximum latewood densities and tree-ring widths of the two Abies species along the altitude.},

Here we presented a five-century long reconstruction of summer (June to August) temperature based on a tree ring-width chronology of Picea brachytyla var. complanata originating from the Hengduan Mountains of China. Climate-growth response analysis showed that summer temperature was the main climatic factor limiting tree-ring growth in the study area. The reconstructed summer temperature accounted for 47.6{\%} of the variance in actual temperature during their common period A.D. 1958–2002. Analysis of the temperature reconstruction showed that major warm periods occurred in the A.D. 1710s–1750s, 1850s, 1920s–1950s and 1990s to present, whereas cold intervals occurred in the A.D. 1630s–1680s, 1790s–1800s, 1860s–1880s and 1950s–1980s, respectively. The low-frequency variation of the reconstruction agreed fairly well with tree-ring reconstructed temperature from nearby regions and with records of glacier fluctuations in the surrounding high mountains, suggesting that our reconstructed summer temperature was reliable, and could aid in the evaluation of regional climate variability.},

abstract = {Global warming has become one of the major challenges in maintaining global food security. This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on fourteen strategic crops for eight sub-Saharan Africa countries. Climate change is projected to increase median temperature by 1.4-5.5 degrees C and median precipitation by -2{\%} to 20{\%} by the end of the 21st century. However, large levels of uncertainty exist with temporal and spatial variability of rainfall events. The impact of climate change on crop yields in the region is largely negative. Among the grain crops, wheat is reported as the most vulnerable crop, for which up to 72{\%} of the current yield is projected to decline. For other grain crops, such as maize, rice and soybean, up to 45{\%} yield reductions are expected by the end of this century. Two grain crops, millet and sorghum, are more resilient to climate change for which projected impacts on crop yields are},

abstract = {The identification of properties that contribute to the persistence and resilience of ecosystems despite climate change constitutes a research priority of global relevance. Here we present a novel, empirical approach to assess the relative sensitivity of ecosystems to climate variability, one property of resilience that builds on theoretical modelling work recognizing that systems closer to critical thresholds respond more sensitively to external perturbations. We develop a new metric, the vegetation sensitivity index, that identifies areas sensitive to climate variability over the past 14 years. The metric uses time series data derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index, and three climatic variables that drive vegetation productivity (air temperature, water availability and cloud cover). Underlying the analysis is an autoregressive modelling approach used to identify climate drivers of vegetation productivity on monthly timescales, in addition to regions with memory effects and reduced response rates to external forcing. We find ecologically sensitive regions with amplified responses to climate variability in the Arctic tundra, parts of the boreal forest belt, the tropical rainforest, alpine regions worldwide, steppe and prairie regions of central Asia and North and South America, the Caatinga deciduous forest in eastern South America, and eastern areas of Australia. Our study provides a quantitative methodology for assessing the relative response rate of ecosystems--be they natural or with a strong anthropogenic signature--to environmental variability, which is the first step towards addressing why some regions appear to be more sensitive than others, and what impact this has on the resilience of ecosystem service provision and human well-being.},

abstract = {We conducted dendroecological analyses in 80- year-long tree ring chronologies to detect neighborhood effects (competition intensity, species identity) on the d13C signature of tree rings and radial stem increment of Fagus sylvatica trees growing either in monospecific or mixed patches of a temperate forest. We hypothesized that tree ring d13C is a more sensitive indicator of neighborhood effects and the impact of climate variability on growth than is ring width. We found a closer correlation of summer precipitation to d13C than to ring width. While the ring width showed a decline over the test period (1926–2005), the mean curve of d13C increased until the mid of the 1970s, remained high until about 1990, and markedly decreased thereafter. Possible explanations related to ontogeny and environmental change (‘age effect' due to canopy closure; elevated atmospheric SO2 concentrations in the 1960s–1980s) are discussed. Beech target trees sur- rounded by many allospecific trees had a significantly lower mean d13C in the period 1926–1975 than beech with predominantly or exclusively conspecific neighborhood, possibly indicating a more favorable water supply of beech in diverse stands. Contrary to expectation, trees subject to more intense competition by neighboring trees (measured by Hegyi's competition index) had lower d13C values in their tree rings, which is thought to reflect denser canopies being linked to increased shading. We conclude that tree ring d13C time series represent combined archives of cli- mate variability, stand history and neighborhood effects on tree physiology and growth that may add valuable information to that obtained from conventional tree ring analysis.},

This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

abstract = {Leafing phenology of two dry-forest sites on soils of different depth (S = shallow, D = deep) at Shipstern Reserve, Belize, were compared at the start of the rainy season (April-June 2000). Trees ? 2.5 cm dbh were recorded weekly for 8 wk in three 0.04-ha plots per site. Ten species were analysed individually for their phenological patterns, of which the three most common were Bursera simaruba, Metopium brownei and Jatropha gaumeri. Trees were divided into those in the canopy ({\textgreater} 10 cm dbh) and the subcanopy (? 10 cm dbh). Site S had larger trees on average than site D. The proportion of trees flushing leaves at any one time was generally higher in site S than in site D, for both canopy and subcanopy trees. Leaf flush started 2 wk earlier in site S than site D for subcanopy trees, but only 0.5 wk earlier for the canopy trees. Leaf flush duration was 1.5 wk longer in site S than site D. Large trees in the subcanopy flushed leaves earlier than small ones at both sites but in the canopy just at site D. Large trees flushed leaves earlier than small ones in three species and small trees flushed leaves more rapidly in two species. Bursera and Jatropha followed the general trends but Metopium, with larger trees in site D than site S, showed the converse with onset of flushing 1 wk earlier in site D than site S. Differences in response of the canopy and subcanopy trees on each site can be accounted for by the predominance of spring-flushing or stem-succulent species in site S and a tendency for evergreen species to occur in site D. Early flushing of relatively larger trees in site D most likely requires access to deeper soil water reserves but small and large trees utilize stored tree water in site S.},

abstract = {In this study, we use two ecological forest models, namely FORMIX3 and FORREG, to analyse the impact of logging on tropical rain forests and to discuss needs for and problems of an economic extension of these models. The FORMIX3 model simulates spatial-temporal dynamics of tropical forests using an individual and process based approach. The main processes included are growth, mortality, competition, and regeneration of trees. The FORREG model simulates wood growth of tropical forests at landscape scale based on differential equations. Regeneration capabilities of logged forests are analysed and compared for different logging strategies. While conventional management strategies with a short logging cycle (here 20 years) produce low yields and cause severe changes in tree species composition, a reduced impact logging strategy with a longer cycle (here 60 years) leads to relatively high yields and causes moderate changes in species composition. Thus, longer logging cycles are preferable from an ecological point of view. However, also economic aspects influence logging decisions, thus a closer analysis of additional economic aspects of forest management is inevitable. We discuss which economic shortcomings of present rain forest models should be dealt with in the future and which additional data is needed as a consequence. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth.

abstract = {Several North American broad-leaved tree species range from the northern United States at approximately 47 degrees N to moist tropical montane forests in Mexico and Central America at 15-20 degrees N. Along this gradient the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month (T (Jan)), which characterize annual variation in temperature, increase from -10 to 12 degrees C and tree phenology changes from deciduous to leaf-exchanging or evergreen in the southern range with a year-long growing season. Between 30 and 45 degrees N, the time of bud break is highly correlated with T (Jan) and bud break can be reliably predicted for the week in which mean minimum temperature rises to 7 degrees C. Temperature-dependent deciduous phenology-and hence the validity of temperature-driven phenology models-terminates in southern North America near 30 degrees N, where T (Jan){\textgreater}7 degrees C enables growth of tropical trees and cultivation of frost-sensitive citrus fruits. In tropical climates most temperate broad-leaved species exchange old for new leaves within a few weeks in January-February, i.e., their phenology becomes similar to that of tropical leaf-exchanging species. Leaf buds of the southern ecotypes of these temperate species are therefore not winter-dormant and have no chilling requirement. As in many tropical trees, bud break of Celtis, Quercus and Fagus growing in warm climates is induced in early spring by increasing daylength. In tropical climates vegetative phenology is determined mainly by leaf longevity, seasonal variation in water stress and day length. As water stress during the dry season varies widely with soil water storage, climate-driven models cannot predict tree phenology in the tropics and tropical tree phenology does not constitute a useful indicator of global warming.},

abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of species that basically depend on the same resources has been a brainteaser for generations of ecologists. Different mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate coexistence in plant communities, where space is an important resource. Using a stochastic cellular automaton simulation model we analyze - separately and in combination - the influence of different species traits and processes which alter local competition on the coexistence of plant species over a fixed time horizon. We show that different species traits operate on different time scales in competition. We therefore suggest the concept of weak versus strong traits according to short- or long-term exclusion of species differing in these traits. As a consequence, highly non-linear trade-offs between weak and strong traits can result in communities. Furthermore, we found that trade-offs based on physiological species traits such as plant lifetime, dispersal range and plant growth, did not support broad and long-term coexistence-further processes such as density-dependent mortality and light-dependent colonization were necessary. This suggests that coexistence in plant communities requires (stabilizing) local processes to support the (equalizing) trade-offs in species traits. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mapping the aboveground biomass of tropical forests is essential both for implementing conservation policy and reducing uncertainties in the global carbon cycle. Two medium resolution (500 m - 1000 m) pantropical maps of vegetation biomass have been recently published, and have been widely used by sub-national and national-level activities in relation to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). Both maps use similar input data layers, and are driven by the same spaceborne LiDAR dataset providing systematic forest height and canopy structure estimates, but use different ground datasets for calibration and different spatial modelling methodologies. Here, we compare these two maps to each other, to the FAO's Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010 country-level data, and to a high resolution (100 m) biomass map generated for a portion of the Colombian Amazon.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We find substantial differences between the two maps, in particular in central Amazonia, the Congo basin, the south of Papua New Guinea, the Miombo woodlands of Africa, and the dry forests and savannas of South America. There is little consistency in the direction of the difference. However, when the maps are aggregated to the country or biome scale there is greater agreement, with differences cancelling out to a certain extent. When comparing country level biomass stocks, the two maps agree with each other to a much greater extent than to the FRA 2010 estimates. In the Colombian Amazon, both pantropical maps estimate higher biomass than the independent high resolution map, but show a similar spatial distribution of this biomass.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Biomass mapping has progressed enormously over the past decade, to the stage where we can produce globally consistent maps of aboveground biomass. We show that there are still large uncertainties in these maps, in particular in areas with little field data. However, when used at a regional scale, different maps appear to converge, suggesting we can provide reasonable stock estimates when aggregated over large regions. Therefore we believe the largest uncertainties for REDD+ activities relate to the spatial distribution of biomass and to the spatial pattern of forest cover change, rather than to total globally or nationally summed carbon density.},

abstract = {1. Considerable debate surrounds the extent to which tropical forests can be managed for resource extraction while conserving biodiversity and ecosystem properties, which depend on functional composition. Here we evaluate the compatibility of these aims by examining the effects of logging on taxonomic and functional diversity and composition in a tropical forest. 2. Twenty years after selective logging, we inventoried 4140 stems regenerating in logging gaps and adjacent undisturbed areas, and we integrated a database of 13 functional traits describing leaf and wood economics of tropical trees. 3. We found no differences in taxonomic and functional richness among habitats, but logging gaps had significantly higher taxonomic and functional evenness. 4. Logging also effected striking, long-term changes in both species and functional composition. In particular, the xylem density of recruits in logging gaps was 6{\%} less than in unlogged forests, leaves were 11{\%}less tough and had 6–13{\%}greater mineral nutrient concentrations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that managers of tropical forests should limit overall surface area converted to logging gaps by creating fewer, larger gaps during selective logging, to reduce impacts on the taxonomic and functional composition of the regenerating stand.},

abstract = {Forests cover much of the earth's surface and are regularly logged. Well established ecological theory predicts, and the results of extensive silvicultural studies demonstrate the role of disturbance in maintaining species richness in forests; however, logging and other human initiated disturbance is often credited with the degradation of forest ecosystems throughout the world. Presented here are the results of a meta-analysis of 19 published studies investigating 25 distinct paired human-disturbed and primary forests in the tropical and temperate biomes. Regardless of whether studies were grouped across biomes or considered independently, the current literature indicates a significant reduction in tree species richness following logging. While the reasons for this reduction in richness are as diverse as the forests considered here, some common themes are clear. Although logging may increase the richness of early successional tree species, it also tends to reduce the richness of late successional trees. This occurs both through the altering biotic and abiotic processes regulating resource availability and through size-class and species based selection biases common in logging. Logging also makes primary forests more accessible, setting the stage for a chronic human disturbance cycle. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Mette2013,
abstract = {The growth behavior of coexisting tree species under climate change is important from an ecological, silvicultural and economic perspective. While many previous studies are concerned with climatic limits for species occurrence, we focus on climate related shifts in interspecific competition. A landmark for these changes in competition is the ‘climatic turning point' (CTP): those climate conditions under which a rank reversal between key tree species occurs. Here, we used a common type of temperate mixed forest in Central Europe with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) to explore the CTP under a future climate projection of increasing temperature and aridity. We selected a dry region where the prerequisite of differential climate sensitivity in mixed beech-oak forests was fulfilled: In-situ dendrochronological analyses demonstrated that the currently more competitive beech was more drought sensitive than sessile oak. We then used two complementary forest growth models, namely SILVA and LandClim, to investigate the climate induced rank-reversal in species dominance and to quantify it as the CTP from beech to oak by simulating future forest development from the WETTREG 2010 A1B climate projection. Utilizing two models allowed us to draw conclusions robust against the assumptions of a particular model. Both models projected a CTP at a mean annual temperature of 11–128C (July temperature .188C) and a precipitation sum of 500–530 mm. However, the change in tree species composition can exhibit a time-lag of several decades depending on past stand development and current stand structure. We conclude that the climatic turning point is a simple yet effective reference measure to study climate related changes in interspecific competition, and confirm the importance of competition sensitivity in climate change modeling.

abstract = {Large areas of African moist forests are being logged in the context of supposedly sustainable management plans. It remains however controversial whether harvesting a few trees per hectare can be maintained in the long term while preserving other forest services as well. We used a unique 24 year silvicultural experiment, encompassing 10 4 ha plots established in the Central African Republic, to assess the effect of disturbance linked to logging (two to nine trees ha(-1) greater than or equal to 80 cm DBH) and thinning (11-41 trees ha(-1) greater than or equal to 50 cm DBH) on the structure and dynamics of the forest. Before silvicultural treatments, above-ground biomass (AGB) and timber stock (i.e. the volume of commercial trees greater than or equal to 80 cm DBH) in the plots amounted 374.5 ± 58.2 Mg ha(-1) and 79.7 ± 45.9 m(3) ha(-1), respectively. We found that (i) natural control forest was increasing in AGB (2.58 ± 1.73 Mg dry mass ha(-1) yr(-1)) and decreasing in timber stock (-0.33 ± 1.57 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)); (ii) the AGB recovered very quickly after logging and thinning, at a rate proportional to the disturbance intensity (mean recovery after 24 years: 144{\{}{\%}{\}}). Compared with controls, the gain almost doubled in the logged plots (4.82 ± 1.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tripled in the logged + thinned plots (8.03 ± 1.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)); (iii) the timber stock recovered slowly (mean recovery after 24 years: 41{\{}{\%}{\}}), at a rate of 0.75 ± 0.51 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) in the logged plots, and 0.81 ± 0.74 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) in the logged + thinned plots. Although thinning significantly increased the gain in biomass, it had no effect on the gain in timber stock. However, thinning did foster the growth and survival of small- and medium-sized timber trees and should have a positive effect over the next felling cycle.},

abstract = {Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests - starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem - can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.},

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in mean seasonal and annual surface air temperatures over the period of instrumental observations in the Arctic is presented. In addition, the role of atmospheric circulation in controlling the instrumental and decadal-scale changes of air temperature in the Arctic is investigated. Mean monthly temperature and temperature anomalies data from 37 Arctic, 7 sub-Arctic and 30 grid-boxes were used for analysis. The presented analysis shows that the observed variations in air temperature in the real Arctic (defined on the basis of climatic as opposed to other criteria, e.g. astronomical or botanical) are in many aspects not consistent with the projected climatic changes computed by climatic models for the enhanced greenhouse effect. The highest temperatures since the beginning of instrumental observation occurred clearly in the 1930s and can be attributed to changes in atmospheric circulation, The second phase of contemporary global warming (after 1975) is, at most, weakly marked in the Arctic. For example, the mean rate of warming for the period 1991-1995 was 2-3 times lower in the Arctic than the global average. Temperature levels observed in Greenland in the last 10-20 years are similar to those observed in the 19th century. Increases of temperature in the Arctic are more significant in the warm half-year than in the cold half-year. This seasonal pattern in temperature change confirms the view that positive feedback mechanisms (e.g. sea-ice-albedo-temperature) as yet play only a small role in enhancing temperature in the Arctic. Hypotheses are presented to explain the lack of warming in the Arctic after 1975. It is shown that in some parts of the Arctic atmospheric circulation changes, in particular in the cold half-year, can explain up to 10-50{\%} of the temperature variance. For Arctic temperature, the most important factor is a change in the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. The influence of atmospheric circulation change over the Pacific (both in the northern and in the tropical Darts) is significantly lower. Copyright (C) 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tropical canopy dominance in lowland, well-drained forests by one plant species is a long-standing conundrum in tropical biology. Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed-species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small-seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.},

abstract = {In this thesis a software system for modelling and visualisation of forest landscapes named L VIS is introduced. It uses computer visualisation of forest dominated landscapes that are characterised by a long-lasting, temporal dynamic and large spatial extent. By building upon the human ability to derive complex facts from understanding images the system bridges the differences in temporal and spatial scale between the human perception and forest development. The usage of a single-tree simulator in combination with time-lapse techniques allows four dimensional movements in the virtual landscape. The results of the program are presented in three different practical applications.},

abstract = {The spatial patterns of the most abundant tree species on the Paracou experimental plots were all characterised using the same standard method based on the point process theory. Due to the local heterogeneity of environmental conditions, we analysed each species-plot combination independently. They were classified into three types of process (random, regular or aggregated) at different spatial scales. Most species exhibited aggregated patterns and the others showed various spatial structures, depending on the plot. In some cases, this variability could be explained by soil conditions, and in others cases the structures are so complex that we could only suggest possible explanations. These results are then discussed in the light of results previously obtained in other studies conducted on the same species using different methods. We conclude with some methodological proposals.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the landscape of Munessa-Shashemene area of the Ethiopian highlands over a period of 39 years (1973–2012). Satellite images of Landsat MSS (1973), TM (1986), ETM+ (2000), and RapidEye (2012) were used. All images were classified using object-based image classification technique. Accuracy assessments were conducted for each reference year. Change analysis was carried out using post classification comparison in GIS. Nine LULCs were successfully captured with overall accuracies ranging from 85.7{\%} to 93.2{\%} and Kappa statistic of 0.822 to 0.924. The classification result revealed that grasslands (42.3{\%}), natural forests (21{\%}), and woodlands (11.4{\%}) were dominant LULC types in 1973. In 2012, croplands (48.5{\%}) were the major LULC types followed by others. The change result shows that a rapid reduction in woodland cover of 81.8{\%}, 52.3{\%}, and 36.1{\%} occurred between the first (1973–1986), second (1986–2000), and third (2000–2012) study periods, respectively. Similarly, natural forests cover decreased by 26.1{\%} during the first, 21.1{\%} during the second, and 24.4{\%} during the third periods. Grasslands also declined by 11.9, 17.5, and 21.1{\%} during the three periods, respectively. On the contrary, croplands increased in all three periods by 131, 31.5, and 22.7{\%}, respectively. Analysis of the 39-year change matrix revealed that about 60{\%} of the land showed changes in LULC. Changes were also common along the slope gradient and agro-ecological zones with varying proportions. Further study is suggested to investigate detailed drivers and consequences of changes.},

abstract = {A comparison is made between the timber certification system of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) of Germany and the PEFC (Pan-European Forest Certification) of Austria. The comparison of timber certification systems by FSC and PEFC for Austria depends on the state of knowledge that includes at this time regular certifications in domestic operations/regions. For lack of domestic FSC implementation determinations the analysis was made with the German FSC determinations. A difference is the sought for global validity according to FSC in contrast to the European approach of the family forest economy according to the PEFC. Regional certification regularly better accommodates this small area structure. PEFC requires at least 70{\%} certified timber for the trade and processing chain "chain of custody" whereas FSC requires only 30{\%} certified timber. There are above all differences in the formulation of goals. PEFC sets in advance a percentage and species limitation and requires special types and living space for the supply of the hemerobie (variety of types). The {\"{O}}GNU (Austrian Environmental Umbrella Organization) expects a small sales potential for FSC certification above all from large operations and industries. The participation possibilities are clearly regulated according to the German model. In Austria, according to the PEFC, there is the principle of unanimity with a right to veto for the {\"{O}}GNU. The acceptance of the PEFC by timber processors is still awaited. PEFC proponents stress the mutual recognition to avoid the loss of image for timber. Both systems are not accepted unconditionally by environmental organizations. Certification organizations are accredited by the FSC itself but as a rule, with respect to the PEFC, they are accredited by the state. Table.},

Arn. ssp. laricio (Poiret) Maire var Corsicana Hyl.) is a form of black pine endemic to Corsica, that may now be under threat due to current fire regimes and competition with maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton). Material and methods This study aimed to compare postfire mortality in laricio and maritime pine in a mixed stand in northwest Corsica. Diameter at breast height, bark char, bole length charred, and tree mortality were measured in 661 trees 9 months after a severe fire. Logistic regressions were used to determine mortality probabilities which, to compare the two species, were expressed in relation to species, age, and species-independent severity indicators. Results For all ages considered, laricio pine mortality was up to threefold that of maritime pine. The differences between the species were most significant in pines less than 60 years old and exposed to severe conditions. This was mainly due to differences in growth rate between the two species. Conclusion Considering life history traits, maritime pine appears to be better adapted than laricio pine to the risk of fire. As the frequency of major fires in Corsica is on the increase, constituting a real threat for endemic species, we provide a few management guidelines for conservation of the laricio pine.},

While it is always environmentally beneficial to minimize unnecessary damage, more intensive silviculture should not be discouraged in tropical forests in which regeneration and growth of commercially valuable timber species requires such treatments. Failing to regenerate commercial species may render forests more susceptible to conversion to other, more lucrative land uses. Increasing the intensity of silviculture may also decrease the total area of forest exploited for timber, thereby reducing the impacts of over-hunting, timber theft, wildfires, colonization, and conversion, which are facilitated by the increased accessibility of logged areas.},

abstract = {Availability of light and water differs between tropical moist and dry forests, with typically higher understorey light levels and lower water availability in the latter. Therefore, growth trajectories of juvenile trees--those that have not attained the canopy--are likely governed by temporal fluctuations in light availability in moist forests (suppressions and releases), and by spatial heterogeneity in water availability in dry forests. In this study, we compared juvenile growth trajectories of Cedrela odorata in a dry (Mexico) and a moist forest (Bolivia) using tree rings. We tested the following specific hypotheses: (1) moist forest juveniles show more and longer suppressions, and more and stronger releases; (2) moist forest juveniles exhibit wider variation in canopy accession pattern, i.e. the typical growth trajectory to the canopy; (3) growth variation among dry forest juveniles persists over longer time due to spatial heterogeneity in water availability. As expected, the proportion of suppressed juveniles was higher in moist than in dry forest (72 vs. 17{\%}). Moist forest suppressions also lasted longer (9 vs. 5 years). The proportion of juveniles that experienced releases in moist forest (76{\%}) was higher than in dry forest (41{\%}), and releases in moist forests were much stronger. Trees in the moist forest also had a wider variation in canopy accession patterns compared to the dry forest. Our results also showed that growth variation among juvenile trees persisted over substantially longer periods of time in dry forest ({\textgreater}64 years) compared to moist forest (12 years), most probably because of larger persistent spatial variation in water availability. Our results suggest that periodic increases in light availability are more important for attaining the canopy in moist forests, and that spatial heterogeneity in water availability governs long-term tree growth in dry forests.},

Spectral analyses reveal that the reconstruction best resolves variability within the ‘‘classical'' ENSO band of 2–8 years. A low amplitude ENSO epoch in the 17th to 18th centuries broadly coincides with ‘‘Little Ice Age'' conditions over much of the globe. The detailed behavior shows good agreement with shorter tree-ring reconstructions of ENSO over the past few centuries, but differs at times from other longer coral ENSO records and recent model simulations of past ENSO behavior. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies.},

abstract = {Most of the water in the River Nile originates from monsoonal rainfall over the Ethiopian Highlands. Despite warnings of future climate change, little is known about the historical variability in this supply, particularly at annual resolution. Development of tree-ring records in this region has been limited by the occurrence of bi- or multimodal rainfall regimes, causing the development of multiple growth rings that cannot be dated with confidence. In this study, we identified annual rings in 30 Juniperus procera trees from northwest Ethiopia by dendrochronology and AMS radiocarbon dating. Carbon isotope ratios (4 series) and ring widths (73 series) were measured.The carbon isotope series did not contain strong trends possibly attributable to increased anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 concentrations or the juvenile effect. Both carbon isotope values and ring widths were strongly correlated with Blue Nile baseflow, and from composite chronology indices (r=0.75, p {\textless} 0.01), a preliminary reconstruction of Blue Nile baseflow back to AD 1836 was developed. Subsample signal strength remained above 0.85 for most of the reconstruction. Uncertainty bands were relatively narrow and the reliability of the preliminary reconstruction was confirmed by correspondence with reported years of drought and famine. The preliminary reconstruction is characterized by an exceptional decline in baseflow during the late AD 1960s. Flows recovered during the late 1990s. Additional sampling is advised to increase replication, spatial coverage and length of the preliminary reconstruction.},

In this paper, we analyze the seasonality of LAI estimated by three different methods in the Amazonia-savannah transitional forest, located 50 km north-east of Sinop city, Mato Grosso, Brazil. In the first method, we combine Monsi and Saekis' original method [Monsi M, Saeki T (1953) Jpn J Bot 14:22-52], which measures LAI using the Beer-Lambert extinction law, and the proposition of Goudriaan [Goudriaan J (1988) Agric For Meteorol 43:155-169] to estimate the extinction coefficient from solar height. The second method differed from the first only in the way in which the daily fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (FPAR) was calculated, as proposed by Charles-Edwards and Lawn (Charles-Edwards DA, Lawn RJ (1984) Plant Cell Environ 7:247-251]. In the third method, we used a remote sensing technique [MOD15{\_}BU-collection 4, produced and distributed by EROS Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (EDC DAAC)]. We found that the first and the second methods revealed the expected LAI dynamics, which increased during the dry-wet transition and wet season, and decreased during the wet-dry transition and dry season. From 20 randomly distributed sets in a 1.0 ha area, only 3 showed significant differences in LAI estimated from the first two methods; conversely, LAI was overestimated by the third method.},

abstract = {Assessments of the long-term natural regeneration of tropical forests following selective logging are today mostly based on extrapolation of limited empirical observations. Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {We developed chronologies based on the width of tree rings, total area of vessels, and the number of vessels per tree ring of the Prosopis flexuosa wood samples from the xerophytic woodlands of central Argentina. We evaluated the influence of climate on these tree-ring characteristics considering the period from 1940 to 2004 (65 years). The width of the rings, the number of vessels, and the total area of vessels were positively influenced by regional precipitation corresponding to the seasonalized November to December period, which reflects the importance of the water availability in the initial stage of the formation of the wood. The width of the rings and the total area of vessels were negatively influenced by temperature during the same period, while the number of vessels was not significantly correlated with temperature. The high temperatures in spring increase evapotranspiration, which reduces water availability to plants and results in an inverse growth response. This study was the first to develop chronologies based on anatomical characters of wood from the arid and semiarid regions of South America and with significant applications in ecological and climatic studies.},

abstract = {Historical sources indicate that an equivalent of 35 {\%} of Ethiopia's land area had once been covered by natural high forests. At present, no reliable information on the extend and the location of the past and/or actual forest cover was existing for the country. Therefore, a forest monitoring was performed based on airborne and satellite remote sensing data to assess the depletion of Ethiopia's natural high forests within the last 25 years. The change detection analysis, based on satellite images of 1973 to 1976, indicate that in the seventies, natural high forests covered around 4.75 {\%} of the country. Around 10 to 15 years later, only around 0.20 {\%} of the country was still covered by undisturbed natural forests. The annual deforestation rate was calculated at 163,600 ha. Today, remarkable forest stands can only be found in remote and/or inaccessible southern and southwestern parts of the country. A detailed change detection analysis in this region was therefore conducted with airphotos from 1996/97. The results give clear evidence that most intact high forests concentrate within the boundaries of ‘National Forest Priority Areas'. The ongoing deforestation is a result of the very high human pressure on the natural resources. In this context, it is being proposed to design a national Forest Information System (FIS) for selected pilot areas, in order to analyze the processes that contribute to deforestation. In conclusion, the FIS will provide veritable information for improved planning and decision-making in forest management.},

abstract = {Plantations of exotic trees on areas where tropical forest has been clear-felled have been reported to facilitate regrowth of indigenous tree species. This so-called nurse- or shelter tree effect was investigated in a montane semihumid site in southern Ethiopia where plantations of Pinus patula and Eucalyptus saligna grow in close vicinity to the natural Podocarpus falcatus mixed forest. Physiological performance of P. falcatus saplings growing in the exotic and the natural forests was investigated over the year. Compared with the natural forest, photosynthetic carbon gain and growth of the saplings were significantly enhanced under Pinus patula while likewise retarded under Eucalyptus saligna. Diverging effects of the differently dense shelter canopies on the saplings could be traced to differences in the sub-canopy microclimates and particularly to the intensities and temporal distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Moisture also played an important role for photosynthetic carbon gain: while the morning patterns of CO 2 uptake were significantly correlated with the patterns of sunflecks, stomatal conductance was the determinant factor in the afternoon. Analysis of the photosynthetic efficiency of sunflecks revealed a lower quantum yield than the basic diffuse PAR intensity. Compared with a theoretically even distribution of the daily PAR, CO 2 uptake under the real light climate was 70{\%} under Pinus and in the natural forest, and 59{\%} under Eucalyptus. Relating growth rates of Podocarpus saplings to photosynthesis the microclimate under Pinus was 2. 5 times as effective as that in the natural forest and five times more effective than under Eucalyptus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

To deal with uncertainties, countries should adopt flexible mechanisms and can implement REDD+ schemes in stages. Realising REDD+ within countries means paying attention to three key elements: incentives, information and institutions (the 3Is). Incentives consist of performance-based payments and changes in policies. Countries need to provide reliable information on realised changes in forest carbon stocks to qualify for funds from international sources. Effective institutions are needed to manage information and incentives.

abstract = {Variability of soil CO2 efflux strongly depends on soil temperature, soil moisture and plant phenology. Separating the effects of these factors is critical to understand the belowground carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. In Ethiopia with its unreliable seasonal rainfall, variability of soil CO2 efflux may be particularly associated with seasonal variation. In this study, soil respiration was measured in nine plots under the canopies of three indigenous trees (Croton macrostachys, Podocarpus falcatus and Prunus africana) growing in an Afromontane forest of south-eastern Ethiopia. Our objectives were to investigate seasonal and diurnal variation in soil CO2 flux rate as a function of soil temperature and soil moisture, and to investigate the impact of tree species composition on soil respiration. Results showed that soil respiration displayed strong seasonal patterns, being lower during dry periods and higher during wet periods. The dependence of soil respiration on soil moisture under the three tree species explained about 50{\%} of the seasonal variability. The relation followed a Gaussian function, and indicated a decrease in soil respiration at soil volumetric water contents exceeding a threshold of about 30{\%}. Under more moist conditions soil respiration is tentatively limited by low oxygen supply. On a diurnal basis temperature dependency was observed, but not during dry periods when plant and soil microbial activities were restrained by moisture deficiency. Tree species influenced soil respiration, and there was a significant interaction effect of tree species and soil moisture on soil CO2 efflux variability. During wet (and cloudy) period, when shade tolerant late successional P. falcatus is having a physiological advantage, soil respiration under this tree species exceeded that under the other two species. In contrast, soil CO2 efflux rates under light demanding pioneer C. macrostachys appeared to be least sensitive to dry (but sunny) conditions. This is probably related to the relatively higher carbon assimilation rates and associated root respiration. We conclude that besides the anticipated changes in precipitation pattern in Ethiopia any anthropogenic disturbance fostering the pioneer species may alter the future ecosystem carbon balance by its impact on soil respiration. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90{\%} of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

FORMIND2.0 is based on the calculations of the carbon balance of individual trees belonging to 13 different plant functional types. Even single logging events in those rainforests threatened by a lack of recruitment led to shifts in the abundances of species, to species loss, and to forest decline and dieback.

abstract = {Continuous measurements of stem radius variation in trees are obtained with automatic dendrometers that provide time series composed of seasonal tree growth and circadian rhythms of water storage and depletion. Several variables can be extracted from the raw data, such as amplitude and duration of radius increase and contraction, which are useful for understanding intra-annual tree growth, tree physiology and for performing growth-climate relationships. These measurements constitute a large dataset whose manipulation needs numerous algorithms and automatic procedures to efficiently and rapidly extract the information. This paper presents a three-step procedure using two SAS routines to extract the time series describing radius variation and associate them with environmental parameters. The first routine organizes and corrects data and generates outputs in the form of files and plots to visualize the results and improve data correction (first step). The second step consists of a reclassification of the hours of contraction or expansion that have been misclassified by the automatic process. The second routine classifies the daily patterns of stem variation into the three phases of contraction, expansion and radius increment and associates the environmental parameters (third step). An example of the procedure is given, with an explanation of the outputs generated. The advantages and shortcomings of the procedure and its importance for the intra-annual analyses of tree growth are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon bud- get, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates and consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respec- tively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the an- nual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of indepen- dent dynamic global vegetation models. We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as ±1$\sigma$, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global car- bon budget. For the last decade available (2006–2015), EFF was 9.3±0.5 GtCyr−1, ELUC 1.0±0.5 GtCyr−1, GATM 4.5±0.1 GtCyr−1, SOCEAN 2.6±0.5 GtCyr−1, and SLAND 3.1±0.9 GtCyr−1. For year 2015 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9±0.5 GtCyr−1, showing a slowdown in growth of these emissions compared to the average growth of 1.8{\%}yr−1 that took place during 2006–2015. Also, for 2015, ELUC was 1.3±0.5 GtCyr−1, GATM was 6.3±0.2 GtCyr−1, SOCEAN was 3.0±0.5 GtCyr−1, and SLAND was 1.9±0.9 GtCyr−1.GATM was higher in 2015 compared to the past decade (2006–2015), reflect- ing a smaller SLAND for that year. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 399.4±0.1ppm averaged over 2015. For 2016, preliminary data indicate the continuation of low growth in EFF with +0.2{\%} (range of −1.0 to +1.8{\%}) based on national emissions projections for China and USA, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. In spite of the low growth of EFF in 2016, the growth rate in atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to be relatively high because of the persistence of the smaller residual terrestrial sink (SLAND) in response to El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions of 2015–2016. From this projection of EFF and assumed constant ELUC for 2016, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach 565±55 GtC (2075±205GtCO2) for 1870–2016, about 75{\%} from EFF and 25{\%} from ELUC.

abstract = {Tree-ring studies contribute worldwide to the understanding of climate and its relation to tree growth. Long tree-ring chronologies serve as climate proxies for the reconstruction of past, pre-instrument climate and its recent change. In tropical regions, the availability of exactly dated tree-ring chronologies is limited. The dendroclimatic potential of two dominant species from dry forests in northern Namibia was examined in the study presented in this paper. Both species (Burkea africana Hook and Pterocarpus angolensis DC) were sampled at two sites (ca. 900 km apart), and the response to several climatic variables, including ENSO indices, is studied. All specimens showed distinct growth rings and cross-dating between radii was successful for all trees. Species-specific mean curves were built for both sites. The mean curves of different species of the same site synchronised significantly, allowing the construction of a site-specific chronology. Synchronisation between sites was not possible, but spectral analysis of the chronologies implied that both show similar long-term (6.7 year) oscillation patterns. B. africana is more sensitive to rainfall variation than P. angolensis at both sites. Growth response to rainfall was positive, but a time-lag in the reaction occurred between the sites, corresponding to the time-lag of the beginning of the rainy season. Air temperature showed a negative correlation with stem increment at both sites. The response at the westernmost site to two ENSO indices indicates a tree growth decrease during El Nino years, which are generally dry in southern Africa.},

abstract = {A study Was Conducted in a lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Sumatra to assess the structure and dynamics of the forest canopy. The canopy structure was analysed at different scales including a previous mapping of a 5 ha forest mosaic and an interpretation of the canopy architecture along a horizontal gradient between the high forest and a 320 m2 treefall. Canopy geometry was ascertained by analysis of digitized zenithal hemispherical photographs sampled at 25 near-ground sites. Gap size morphology and dispersion varied continuously from the high forest to the treefall. An asymmetric pattern of gaps about the Zenith was CharacteriStic of almost all forest sites. The spatial dispersion of gaps was random in the high forest. It tended to be dumped in the forest border and in the treefall. Plant area indices ranged from 6.5 in the high forest to 2.9 m the treefall. These values reflect a reduced leaf area during a severe dry spell, at the time of measurements. Inclination angles of canopy elements were highly correlated with gap dispersion and canopy openness; as observed from the high forest to the treefall. Implications of canopy heterogeneity men the distribution of light were analysed. The importance of lateral light penetrating from the forest border into the high forest is stressed. The canopy gradient of architecture and geometry from the high forest to the treefall and the very diverse structure of the high forest are emphasized.},

abstract = {Responses to climate change must now focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid runaway impacts (avoiding the unmanageable) and on addressing the impacts that are already with us (managing the unavoidable). Managing natural ecosystems as carbon sinks and resources for adaptation is increasingly recognised as a necessary, efficient and relatively cost-effective strategy. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change recommended that governments develop policies for climate sensitive public goods including natural resource protection, coastal protection and emergency preparedness. The worlds protected area network already helps mitigate and adapt to climate change. Protected areas store 15 per cent of terrestrial carbon and supply ecosystem services for disaster reduction, water supply, food and public health, all of which enable community-based adaptation. Many natural and managed ecosystems can help reduce climate change impacts. But protected areas have advantages over other approaches to natural ecosystem management in terms of legal and governance clarity, capacity and effectiveness. In many cases protection is the only way of keeping carbon locked in and ecosystem services running smoothly. Without the investment made in protected areas systems worldwide, the situation would be even worse. Increasing investment through a partnership of governments, communities, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organisations and the private sector would ensure greater protection of these essential services. Evidence suggests that protected areas work: even since this report was completed, a new World Bank review shows how tropical protected areas, especially those conserved by indigenous peoples, lose less forest than other management systems. But these co-benefits for climate, biodiversity and society are often missed or ignored. This book clearly articulates for the first time how protected areas contribute significantly to reducing impacts of climate change and what is needed for them to achieve even more. As we enter an unprecedented scale of negotiations about climate and biodiversity it is important that these messages reach policy makers loud and clear and are translated into effective policies and funding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Silvicultural treatments are often needed in selectively logged tropical forest to enhance the growth rates of many commercial tree species and, consequently, for recovering a larger proportion of the initial volume harvested over the next cutting cycle. The available data in the literature suggest, however, that the effect of silvicultural treatments on tree growth is smaller in dry forests than in humid forest tree species. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates of future crop trees (FCTs; i.e., trees of current and potentially commercial timber species with adequate form and apparent growth potential). The study was carried out in a tropical dry forest in Bolivia where a set of 21.25-ha plots were monitored for 4 years post-logging. Plots received one of four treatments that varied in intensity of both logging and silvicultural treatments as follows: normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture; and, unlogged controls. The silvicultural treatments applied to FCTs involved liberation from lianas and overtopping trees. Results showed that rates of FCT stem diameter growth increased with light availability, logging intensity, and intensity of silvicultural treatments, and decrease with liana infestation degree. Growth rate increment was larger in the light and intensive silvicultural treatment (22-27{\%}). Long-lived pioneer species showed the strongest response to intensive silviculture (50{\%} increase) followed by total shade-tolerant species (24{\%}) and partial shade-tolerant species (10{\%}). While reduced-impact logging is often not sufficient to guarantee the sustainability of timber yields, application of silvicultural treatments that substantially enhanced the growth rates of FCTs will help move the management of these forests closer to the goal of sustained yield. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

Crossdating was evaluated in COFECHA. Raw measurements of total, earlywood, and latewood widths from the two methods were analyzed using the Verify for Windows program, ANOVA, and correlation matrices. Total ring width and earlywood width were well correlated between techniques and technicians but questionable ring boundaries from image analysis program should be checked under a stereoscope. Juniperus virginiana latewood widths were significantly different between techniques and technicians; therefore, we do not recommend combining latewood measurements from species with limited latewood variability for dendrochronological analysis. A standard definition of the earlywood-latewood boundary that can be replicated across technicians is needed to combine latewood measurements from the sliding measuring stage and image analysis systems. ?? 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

For years, ecological science has shown how large scale forest clearings cause declines in biodiversity and the availability of forest products. Yet some important changes in the rainforests, and in the ecosystem services they provide, have been underappreciated until recently. Emerging research indicates that land use in the Amazon goes far beyond clearing large areas of forest; selective logging and other canopy damage is much more pervasive than once believed. Deforestation causes collateral damage to the surrounding forests - through enhanced drying of the forest floor, increased frequency of fires, and lowered productivity. The loss of healthy forests can degrade key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance and river flow, the modulation of regional climate patterns, and the amelioration of infectious diseases. We review these newly revealed changes in the Amazon rainforests and the ecosystem services that they provide.},

abstract = {Munessa Forest is a mountain forest in south-eastern Ethiopia experiencing seasonal rainfall variation. We investigated seasonal cambial activity and dormancy from increment rates of four different tree species belonging to varying life forms, namely, evergreen native conifer (Podocarpus falcatus), evergreen introduced conifer (Pinus patula), evergreen broadleaved tree (Prunus africana) and deciduous broadleaved tree (Celtis africana). Measurements of stem radius fluctuations were registered with the help of high-resolution electronic dendrometers. Daily amplitudes of stem diameter variations and daily and monthly net growth rates were determined and related to climatic variables measured at local climate stations. Thin sections of wood collected with a microcorer every 3–6 weeks allowed a visual control of newly formed wood cells during consecutive time intervals. Lack of water availability during the long dry season induced cambial dormancy of 5–7 months depending on life forms. After the onset of the short rainy season, stem swelling started quite synchronously with a variation of only single days in all studied species. Evergreen tree species were able to initiate wood formation during the short rainy season, whereas growth in the deciduous broadleaved species started in the long rainy season. The acquired data provide a basis for delineating the species-specific growth boundaries and the duration of the cambial growing season.},

abstract = {In this paper a new model for simulation of the growth of tropical rain forest is presented (FORMIX3). The model describes growth, mortality, recruitment of trees and competition between trees. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. The carbon gain of a tree depends on the photo production of its leaves, respiration and other losses. Trees compete for light and space. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Based on an extensive field data review, a parametrisation was developed for the simulation of lowland Dipterocarp rain forest at Deramakot, Malaysia. A total of 28 variables describing different aspects of forest structure and growth were compared with field data. The model reproduces most parts of the forest dynamics well. A new concept for sensitivity analysis is presented: 46 Model parameter were varied and analysed in respect to their influence on 26 variables describing the forest state. The influence of the different processes on forest structure is complex. Some general trends can be observed: The growth characteristics of the two Dipterocarp species groups strongly influences species composition in the forest, but not general forest structure (biomass, leaf area, production, leaf area, tree size distribution) (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Tropical forest conversion, shifting cultivation and clearing of secondary vegetation make significant contributions to global emissions of greenhouse gases today, and have the potential for large additional emissions in future decades. Globally, an estimated 3.1 x 109 t of biomass carbon of these types is exposed to burning annually, of which 1.1 x 109 t is emmitted to the atmosphere through combustion and 49 x 106 t is converted to charcoal (including 26-31 x 106 t C of black carbon). The amount of biomass exposed to burning includes aboveground remains that failed to burn or decompose from clearing in previous years, and therefore exceeds the 1.9 x 109 t of aboveground biomass carbon cleared on average each year. Above- and belowground carbon emitted annually through decomposition processes totals 2.1 x 109 t C. A total gross emission (including decomposition of unburned aboveground biomass and of belowground biomass) of 3.41 x 109 t C year-1 results from clearing primary (nonfallow) and secondary (fallow) vegetation in the tropics. Adjustment for trace gas emissions using IPCC Second Assessment Report 100-year integration global warming potentials makes this equivalent to 3.39 x 109 t of CO2-equivalent carbon under a low trace gas scenario and 3.83 x 109 t under a high trace gas scenario. Of these totals, 1.06 x 109 t (31{\%}) is the result of biomass burning under the low trace gas scenario and 1.50 x 109 t (39{\%}) under the high trace gas scenario. The net emissions from all clearing of natural vegetation and of secondary forests (including both biomass and soil fluxes) is 2.0 x 109 t C, equivalent to 2.0-2.4 x 109 t of CO2-equivalent carbon. Adding emissions of 0.4 x 109 t C from land-use category changes other than deforestation brings the total for land-use change (not considering uptake of intact forest, recurrent burning of savannas or fires in intact forests) to 2.4 x 109 t C, equivalent to 2.4-2.9 x 109 t of CO2-equivalent carbon. The total net emission of carbon from the tropical land uses considered here (2.4 x 109 t C year-1) calculated for the 1981-1990 period is 50{\%} higher than the 1.6 x 109 t C year-1 value used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The inferred (= 'missing') sink in the global carbon budget is larger than previously thought. However, about half of the additional source suggested here may be offset by a possible sink in uptake by Amazonian forests. Both alterations indicate that continued deforestation would produce greater impact on global carbon emissions. The total net emission of carbon calculated here indicates a major global warming impact from tropical land uses, equivalent to approximately 29{\%} of the total anthropogenic emission from fossil fuels and land-use change. {\textcopyright} 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Germany has been among the major donor countries supporting forest protection for a long time: during the last three decades it has continuously supported developing countries in their efforts to cope with unsustainable use and conversion of forests through direct programming and activities within its bilateral development cooperation. Convinced of the urgency to facilitate an effective transformative change in the global land sector, Germany continues its support and is also among those countries that promoted REDD+ early on. It considers the concept as a major chance to slow down and eventually reverse the overuse and conversion of forests, especially in recognition that traditional development assistance has not succeeded in stopping the detrimental uses of forest lands. REDD+ is seen as a way to break new ground in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of international support.},

abstract = {We measured radial variation of carbon isotope composition and vessel traits in tree species in seasonally dry forests of Northeast Thailand to explore a more reliable and amenable method of tropical dendrochronology for trees that lack visually detectable and consistent growth rings. Six Dipterocarpaceae species (3 Shorea, 2 Dipterocarpus, and 1 Hopea species) with indistinct or irregular growth rings and teak (Tectona grandis), a species which forms distinct growth rings, were examined. The $\delta$13C value variations in all species showed annual cyclicity. Dipterocarpaceae species usually marked the lowest values of $\delta$13C in the middle of the growing season, whereas teak had the lowest values at nearly the end of the growing season. Since the growing season of the species examined almost corresponds to the rainy season in the study area, the $\delta$13C variation was likely caused by the change in moisture availability. The different variation pattern of teak was attributable to its stronger dependence on 13C-enriched reserved material early in the growing season. Changes in tree vessel traits for all species examined also showed annual cyclicity. Dipterocarpaceae species showed significant correlation between $\delta$13C values and vessel measurements. Vessel lumen (mean area, tangential and radial diameter, and proportion of total area) had a negative correlation, whereas vessel frequency showed a positive correlation. The correlations indicated that changes in vessel traits were caused by the seasonal variation of moisture available to the trees. Thus, we concluded that methods using wood anatomy, as well as $\delta$13C, have great potential for use as tools in tropical dendrochronology within the context of seasonal climate.},

abstract = {In the coming decades, a large fraction of the world's tropical forests will be fragmented into remnants surrounded by secondary vegetation, land-use areas, or roads. It is important to develop integrative tools to monitor the evolution of these fragmented ecosystems. We used the individual-oriented and process-based forest growth simulator FORMIND2.0 to investigate the spatial and temporal effects on standing biomass and functional diversity of various intensities and patterns of fragmentation within a forest landscape. The simulator was calibrated for an old-growth wet forest in French Guiana, South America. We found that the standing biomass of forest remnants was reduced significantly compared to a similar area of nonfragmented forest. When fewer but larger remnants were created rather than many small ones, the total loss in biomass and the increase in the abundance of early-successional species were significantly reduced, confirming that edge effects dominate the functioning of forest remnants. We also performed simulations of secondary succession after the landscape had been abandoned. The simulated recovery time in those secondary forests depends on both the size of cleared area and the spatial pattern of the remnant forests},

abstract = {In publications on tropical forest fragmentation, regrowing secondary forests (SF) on abandoned agricultural land are often overlooked. These forests represent highly fragmented components in the landscape matrix which are generally less than 100 ha in size. SF are found on privately owned land where they are contributing to on-farm income through logging and/or use of non-timber products. Hence, defining pure conservation goals for this forest type seems to be unrealistic. In this paper, we used the process-based model FORMIX3-Q to simulate successional processes and logging scenarios in SF exposed to different degrees of fragmentation (either facing non-forest land on only one side or totally surrounded by agricultural land) in the subtropical eastern part of Paraguay. We compared results with primary forest embedded in a similar matrix. Under light fragmentation, bole volume of SF approached primary forest values after about 50 years of succession. Species composition, however, was clearly distinct from primary forest over the first 200 years of succession. The development of bole volume and species composition in severely fragmented SF was similar to the less fragmented SF over the initial 50 years. However, limited seed input, largely confined to on-site seed sources in the severely fragmented SF, led to a decline in bole volume by about one-third compared to the reference value over the simulation period of 400 years. By applying a minimum felling diameter (MFD) of 35 cm in the lightly fragmented SF, first logging was only possible after 30 years, resulting in a mere 3.7 m3 ha-1 harvest. Highest timber yields were obtained with 10 yr cutting cycles and a maximum removal of 20 stems ha-1, though sustainable yields only resulted from lowering the MFD to 30 cm. Logging in severely fragmented SF accelerated the decline of bole volume. Overall, results suggest that timber production in SF without silvicultural treatments is low and hence does not constitute a viable option to diversify farm income. Only managed SF may serve this function. Research focusing on the elaboration of management options for SF, integrating as much as possible of the original vegetation, is needed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The science of dendrochronology relies on cross-dating techniques to ensure that a particular tree ring is associated with a specific year. Some tree species and environments produce ring-width time series that are difficult to cross-date. The objective of this preliminary study was to determine if stable isotope time series of oxygen (??18O) or carbon (??13C) could provide useful data for cross-dating purposes. Ring-width and stable isotope time series for three to four trees from multiple sites were statistically analyzed with a computer program commonly used in dendrochronology (COFECHA). For pine (Pinus ponderosa), both ??18O and ??13C time series produced as good and occasionally better between-tree correlations than ring-width series. Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is a species that can be difficult to cross-date using ring-width data due to complacent growth and ring anomalies. For the Prairie Creek redwood site, between-tree ??18O time series were more strongly correlated than ring-width series. In some instances within-tree, ring-width series (multiple cores from each tree) were not significantly correlated, again indicating that using ring-width data for cross-dating redwood can be problematic. Although, using isotope chronologies for routine cross-dating is not practical, this study demonstrates that for short sections that are difficult to date or when trying to link limited numbers of cores into an extended chronology, patterns of ??18O and ??13C variation could be used to clarify tree ring dating. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we assess the periodicity of growth-ring formation for 13 stem discs from a site in Central-Northern Ethiopia by crossdating and radiocarbon dating. The crossdating process is described more transparently than usual to allow open discussion of the methodology employed. Although the ring-width series could be tentatively matched, radiocarbon dating revealed that the growth rings of the junipers from the studied site are neither annual nor represent a common periodicity. It was found that the trees are exceptionally sensitive and respond individually to the complex local climate. For future research, it is recommended to select more mesic sites with an unambiguously unimodal rainfall regime and to gain external evidence to support assumptions about the periodicity of growth-ring formation in Juniperus procera. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Climate models predict a range of changes in tropical forest regions, including increased average temperatures, decreased total precipitation, reduced soil moisture and alterations in seasonal climate variations. These changes are directly related to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily CO2. Assessing seasonal forest growth responses to climate is of utmost importance because woody tissues, produced by photosynthesis from atmospheric CO2, water and light, constitute the main component of carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In this paper, we combine intra-annual tree growth measurements from published tree growth data and the corresponding monthly climate data for 25 pan-tropical forest sites. This meta-analysis is designed to find the shared climate drivers of tree growth and their relative importance across pan-tropical forests in order to improve carbon uptake models in a global change context. Tree growth reveals significant intra-annual seasonality at seasonally dry sites or in wet tropical forests. Of the overall variation in tree growth, 28.7{\%} was explained by the site effect, i.e. the tree growth average per site. The best predictive model included four climate variables: precipitation, solar radiation (estimated with extrasolar radiation reaching the atmosphere), temperature amplitude and relative soil water content. This model explained more than 50{\%} of the tree growth variations across tropical forests. Precipitation and solar radiation are the main seasonal drivers of tree growth, causing 19.8{\%} and 16.3{\%} of the tree growth variations. Both have a significant positive association with tree growth. These findings suggest that forest productivity due to tropical tree growth will be reduced in the future if climate extremes, such as droughts, become more frequent.},

abstract = {In high-elevation forests, growth is limited by low temperatures, while in Mediterranean climates drought and high temperatures are the main limiting factors. Consequently, the climate-growth relationships on Mont Ventoux, a mountain in the Mediterranean area, are influenced by both factors. Two co-occurring species were studied: silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), whose geographical distribution depends on their low tolerance to summer drought at low altitude/latitude, and low temperatures (late frost and short length of the growing season) at high altitude/latitude. Firs and beeches distributed along an elevational gradient were investigated using dendroecological methods. Silver fir growth was found to be more sensitive to summer water stress than beech. On the other hand, beech growth was more impacted by extreme events such as the 2003 heat wave, and negatively related to earlier budburst, which suggests a higher sensitivity to late frost. These results are confirmed by the different altitudinal effects observed in both species. Beech growth decreases with altitude whereas an optimum of growth potential was observed at intermediate elevations for silver fir. Recent global warming has caused a significant upward shift of these optima. As found for the period 2000-2006, rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall may restrain growth of silver fir. If these trends continue in the future beech might be favored at low altitudes. The species will have a reduced capacity to migrate to higher altitudes due to its sensitivity to late frosts, although an upward shift of silver fir is likely.},

abstract = {To solve problems caused by conventional forest management, forest certification has emerged as a driver of sustainable forest management. Several sustainable forest management certification systems exist, including the Forest Stewardship Council and those endorsed by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, such as the Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forestry Management Standard CAN/CSA - Z809 and Sustainable Forestry Initiative. For consumers to use certified products to meet their own sustainability goals, they must have an understanding of the effectiveness of different certification systems. To understand the relative performance of three systems, we determined: (1) the criteria used to compare the Forest Stewardship Council, Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forestry Management, and Sustainable Forestry Initiative, (2) if consensus exists regarding their ability to achieve sustainability goals, and (3) what research gaps must be filled to improve our understanding of how forest certification systems affect sustainable forest management. We conducted a qualitative meta-analysis of 26 grey literature references (books, industry and nongovernmental organization publications) and 9 primary literature references (articles in peer-reviewed academic journals) that compared at least two of the aforementioned certification systems. The Forest Stewardship Council was the highest performer for ecological health and social sustainable forest management criteria. The Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forestry Management and Sustainable Forestry Initiative performed best under sustainable forest management criteria of forest productivity and economic longevity of a firm. Sixty-two percent of analyses were comparisons of the wording of certification system principles or criteria; 34{\%} were surveys of foresters or consumers. An important caveat to these results is that only one comparison was based on empirically collected field data. We recommend that future studies collect ecological and socioeconomic data from forests so purchasers can select certified forest products based on empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Simulation models for growth of tropical forest can be a useful tool to investigate the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper the rain forest growth model FORMIX3 is used for such a study. As main processes, the FORMIX3 model includes tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. Two different logging methods (conventional and low impact logging) in combination with different cutting cycles (from 20 to 100 years) were investigated for their long-term impact on the forest. We characterize the impacts with four indicators: total yield, yield per cut, species composition, and canopy opening. Our simulation results indicate that too short logging cycles ({\textless}40 years) overuse this forest. The corresponding yields are low and the species composition is highly disturbed. For conservation of species composition and minimizing erosion risk, logging cycles of 80 or 100 years in combination with low impact methods are recommended. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the origin of the $\delta$ 18O and $\delta$ 2H content of meteoric waters is the initial step in using these isotopes in water resources, hydrological and hydro-climatic investigations. Specifically, isotopes of water are proven tools in a) constraining rate and mechanism of groundwater recharge, b) tracing movement of groundwaters, c) reconstructing past climate (rainfall amount, humidity and temperature) at various time scales, d) quantifying water flux across boundaries (e.g. evaporation rates, mixing), and e) complementing regional and global climate models. The $\delta$ 18O and $\delta$ 2H values in rainfall waters of Ethiopia have long been recognised as a 'regional anomaly'. Regardless of the station's high altitude (2360 m asl) and the region's low mean annual temperature (16 °C), two conditions that would otherwise lead to relative isotope depletion, the rains show the highest 18O composition with no sign of effect of evaporative enrichment (as revealed by d-excess). This enrichment is also reflected in other local meteoric waters (shallow groundwaters, lakes, ambient vapour and rivers). Here, the $\delta$ 18O and $\delta$ 2H of 600 lake water samples, 3000 groundwater samples, and rainfall isotope data base from IAEA/WMO stations at Addis Ababa have been used to show the linkage between rainfall derivation processes and isotope signals. The major sources of moisture in Ethiopia are recycled moisture from continental sources for western and northern Ethiopia, and direct moisture from the Southern Indian Ocean for eastern lowlands of Ethiopia. Southern Ethiopia is influenced by South Indian Ocean moisture, which is characterised by relatively depleted 18O and 2H. Spatial variation (altitude and latitude) in 18O and 2H is weak, with altitude effect accounting for 0.1‰/100 m depletion in $\delta$ 18O. Detailed investigation of the relation between isotope pattern and isotope effects (amount, seasonality, temperature, etc.) shows that these effects are not pronounced. The -4.5‰ $\delta$ 18O shift recorded in deeper groundwaters and other paleo-climate achieves (from the current wt. mean rainfall value of -0.5‰) can only be explained by a shift in source of moisture, such as the northward penetration of the South Indian Ocean moisture into the Ethiopian highlands, or changes in evaporation conditions at the source. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {Cambial activity is influenced by many environmental and physiological factors and among them, carbon acts as a source of energy for the growing meristems. This work has focused on the intra-annual stem growth of poplar compared with the carbon available for xylogenesis processes in cambium and outer wood. The major stages of xylem production and differentiation in two poplar genotypes with different growth performances were considered. Monitoring of stem growth and leaf phenology combined with starch, nonstructural soluble sugars and water content in the stem was conducted from February to November 2006 in Populus x canadensis Moench 'I-214' and Populus deltoides Marsh. 'Dvina'. Anatomical analyses of wood formation were performed by measuring the width of the zones with differentiating and mature xylem. At the end of the growing period, wood density was assessed by microdensity analyses. Xylem differentiation at the top of the tree started at the beginning of April for both genotypes and proceeded down the stem at about 0.5 m day(-1), occurring almost at the same time as leaf opening. The rate of growth and wood density was superior in Dvina, but this higher productivity could not be explained by differences in the number of cambial initials and the duration of xylogenesis. However, the most productive poplar genotype showed higher glucose, fructose and sucrose content in the outer wood. The nonstructural soluble sugars available in the cambial zone followed the intra-annual pattern of xylem formation, with a higher concentration when the growth rate was maximum. The accumulations of nonstructural soluble sugars at a certain time during stem growth corresponded with a higher carbon availability to the actively growing meristems in the stem.},

We suggest a new relative ranking method for identifying priority conservation areas that integrates both biological and social aspects. It is based on the following criteria: the habitat's status, human population pressure, human efforts to protect habitat, and number of endemic plant and vertebrate species. We used this method to rank 25 hotspots, 17 megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within each megadiverse country. We used consistent, comprehensive, georeferenced, and multiband data sets and analytical remote sensing and geographic information system tools to quantify habitat status, human population pressure, and protection status. The ranking suggests that the Philippines, Atlantic Forest, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean Islands, Caucasus, and Indo-Burma are the hottest hotspots and that China, the Philippines, and India are the hottest megadiverse countries. The great variation in terms of habitat, protected areas, and population pressure among the hotspots, the megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within the same country suggests the need for hotspot- and country-specific conservation policies.},

CO2FIX V.2 is a multi-cohort ecosystem-level model based on carbon accounting of forest stands, including forest biomass, soils and products. Carbon stored in living biomass is estimated with a forest cohort model that allows for competition, natural mortality, logging, and mortality due to logging damage. Soil carbon is modeled using five stock pools, three for litter and two for humus. The dynamics of carbon stored in wood products is simulated with a set of pools for short-, medium- and long-lived products, and includes processing efficiency, re-use of by-products, recycling, and disposal forms. The CO2FIX V.2 model estimates total carbon balance of alternative management regimes in both even and uneven-aged forests, and thus has a wide applicability for both temperate and tropical conditions. Results for the model testing and validation in selected temperate and tropical forest management systems are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Tree vigor is often used as a covariate when tree mortality is predicted from tree growth in tropical forest dynamic models, but it is rarely explicitly accounted for in a coherent modeling framework. We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests.},

abstract = {Analyses of tree diversity and community composition in tropical rain forests are usually based either on general herbarium data or on a restricted number of botanical plots. Despite their high taxonomic accuracy, both types of data are difficult to extrapolate to landscape scales. Meanwhile, forestry surveys provide quantitative occurrence data on large areas, and are thus increasingly used for landscape-scale analyses of tree diversity. However, the reliability of these approaches has been challenged because of the ambiguity of the common (vernacular) names used by foresters and the complexity of tree taxonomy in those hyper-diverse communities.We developed and tested a novel approach to evaluate taxonomic reliability of forestry surveys and to propagate the resulting uncertainty in the estimates of several diversity indicators (alpha and beta entropy, Fisher-alpha and S{\o}rensen similarity). Our approach is based on Monte-Carlo processes that simulate communities by taking into account the expected accuracy and reliability of common names. We tested this method in French Guiana, on 9 one-hectare plots (4279 trees - DBH. ≥. 10. cm) for which both common names and standardized taxonomic determinations were available. We then applied our method of community simulation on large forestry inventories (560. ha) at the landscape scale and compared the diversity indices obtained for 10 sites with those computed from precise botanical determination situated at the same localities.We found that taxonomic reliability of forestry inventories varied from 22{\%} (species level) to 83{\%} (family level) in this Amazonian region. Indices computed directly with raw forestry data resulted in incorrect values, except for Gini-Simpson beta-diversity. On the contrary, our correction method provides more accurate diversity estimates, highly correlated with botanical measurements, for almost all diversity indices at both regional and local scales. We obtained a robust ranking of sites consistent with those shown by botanical inventories.These results show that (i) forestry inventories represent a significant part of taxonomic information, (ii) the relative diversity of regional sites can be successfully ranked using forestry inventory data using our method and (iii) forestry inventories can valuably contribute to the detection of large-scale diversity patterns when biases are well-controlled and corrected.The tools we developed as R-functions are available in supplementary material and can be adapted with local parameters to be used for forest management and conservation issues in other regional contexts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on a recently assembled checklist of the woody plants occurring in this region, we analysed their geographical and altitudinal distribution patterns. The montane seasonally dry forest region (at an altitude between 1,000 and 1,100 m, and the smallest in terms of area) was outstanding in terms of total species richness and number of endemics. The extensive seasonally dry forest formations in the Ecuadorean and Peruvian lowlands and hills (i. e., forests below 500 m altitude) were comparatively much more species poor. It is remarkable though, that there were so many fewer collections in the Peruvian departments and Ecuadorean provinces with substantial mountainous areas, such as Cajamarca and Loja, respectively, indicating that these places have a potentially higher number of species. We estimate that some form of protected area (at country, state or private level) is currently conserving only 5{\%} of the approximately 55,000 km2 of remaining SDF in the region, and many of these areas protect vegetation at altitudes below 500 m altitude. In contrast, the more diverse seasonally dry forests in mountainous areas remain little protected. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2009.},

abstract = {The Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) program emerging as a part of the international climate change regime holds the potential to dramatically affect forestry in the tropics. REDD+ has demonstrated an ability to overcome the major political obstacles to earlier efforts to promote sustainable forest management (SFM) in the tropics, but key questions regarding its on-the-ground impact remain. This article suggests that REDD+ can become a successful vehicle for advancing SFM if it is re-conceived to include support for adaptation as one of its primary goals. Some degree of adaptation is necessary to effectively implement any form of REDD+, and SFM practices offer the core toolkit for securing forest adaptation in the context of REDD+. Re-envisioning REDD+ as a dual-focus program aimed at mitigation and adaptation builds upon the potential synergies between these two climate regime goals and calls upon experiences with SFM to provide the means of achieving them. Operationalizing this vision will require development of novel arrangements of authority and incentives across scales of governance that can provide opportunities for learning in support of a larger need for new approaches to governance of global environmental issues. Thus, integrating adaptation into REDD+ can advance not only climate change regime goals, but also long-standing SFM goals and the increasingly apparent demand for more effective international environmental governance generally.},

In accordance with other studies, the years 1693, 1725, 1819, 1868, 1878, 1887 and 1893, which were below two standard deviations, were determined as the driest years in the eastern Mediterranean basin. The distribution of dry and wet periods over time was irregular, and the time between two dry periods was not less than 6 years. There was a significant negative correlation between concurrent April-August North Atlantic oscillation and instrumental precipitation, but it was lower with reconstructed April-August precipitation and nonsignificant. The present results could be useful in the planning and management of water resources and agricultural activities in the region. Copyright ? 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The tropical dry forests constitute a mosaic composed of several phenological functional types adapted to seasonal drought in different ways. Various functional types differ with respect to phenological timing and triggering factors, water relations, extent of deciduousness ({\~{}} leaflessness), etc. Duration of deciduousness in tropical trees (reflecting integrated effect of seasonal drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions) is related to leafing patterns and resource use rates. Vegetative and flowering phenology of trees in dry tropics is primarily affected by the periodicity of rainfall and soil water availability. Occurrence of leaf-flushing as well as flowering during summer in majority of Indian tropical trees, when drought is severe, seems to be a unique adaptation to survive under strongly seasonal climate having a short growth promoting wet period and a long growth constraining dry period. The key phenological themes that need research focus in the dry tropics are: duration of deciduousness, timing of vegetative bud break, leaf strategy, water relations, seasonal flowering types and asynchrony. Analysis of functional types based on the duration of deciduousness and timing of bud break may enable better assessment of future climate change impact. There is a need for long-term quantitative documentation of tree phenological patterns in India through a phenological station network in diverse climatic/ vegetational zones.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Forest management in Europe is committed to sustainability. In the face of climate change and accompanying risks, however, planning in order to achieve this aim becomes increasingly challenging, underlining the need for new and innovative methods. Models potentially integrate a wide range of system knowledge and present scenarios of variables important for any management decision. In the past, however, model development has mainly focused on specific purposes whereas today we are increasingly aware of the need for the whole range of information that can be provided by models. It is therefore assumed helpful to review the various approaches that are available for specific tasks and to discuss how they can be used for future management strategies. SCOPE: Here we develop a concept for the role of models in forest ecosystem management based on historical analyses. Five paradigms of forest management are identified: (1) multiple uses, (2) dominant use, (3) environmentally sensitive multiple uses, (4) full ecosystem approach and (5) eco-regional perspective. An overview of model approaches is given that is dedicated to this purpose and to developments of different kinds of approaches. It is discussed how these models can contribute to goal setting, decision support and development of guidelines for forestry operations. Furthermore, it is shown how scenario analysis, including stand and landscape visualization, can be used to depict alternatives, make long-term consequences of different options transparent, and ease participation of different stakeholder groups and education. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the current challenge of forest ecosystem management in Europe is to integrate system knowledge from different temporal and spatial scales and from various disciplines. For this purpose, using a set of models with different focus that can be selected from a kind of toolbox according to particular needs is more promising than developing one overarching model, covering ecological, production and landscape issues equally well.},

abstract = {Rainforests occur in high precipitation areas of eastern Australia, along a gradient in seasonality of precipitation, ranging from a summer dry season in the temperate south to a winter dry season in the tropical north. The response of net photosynthesis to increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was measured in a range of Australian rainforest trees from different latitudes to investigate possible differences in their response to atmospheric drought. Plants were grown in glasshouses under ambient or low VPD to determine the effect of growth VPD on the photosynthetic response. Temperate species, which experience low summer precipitation, were found to maintain maximum net photosynthesis over the measurement range of VPD (0.5–1.9 kPa). In contrast, the tropical species from climates with high summer precipitation showed large reductions in net photosynthesis with increasing VPD. Temperate species showed higher intrinsic water-use efficiencies under low VPD than the tropical species, whereas their efficiencies were similar under high VPD. Growing plants under a low VPD had little effect on either the photosynthetic response to VPD or the intrinsic water-use efficiency of the species. These different responses of gas exchange to VPD shown by the tropical and temperate rainforest species may reflect different strategies to maximise pro- ductivity in their respective climates.},

abstract = {Managing tropical rain forests is difficult because few long-term field data on forest growth and the impact of harvesting disturbance are available. Growth models may provide a valuable tool for managers of tropical forests, particularly if applied to the extended forest areas of up to 100,000 ha that typically constitute the so-called forest management units (FMUs). We used a stand growth model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to simulate tropical rain forest growth at the FMU level. We applied the process-based rain forest growth model Formix 3-Q to the 55,000 ha Deramakot Forest Reserve (DFR) in Sabah, Malaysia. The FMU was considered to be composed of single and independent small-scale stands differing in site conditions and forest structure. Field data, which were analyzed with a GIS, comprised a terrestrial forest inventory, site and soil analyses (water, nutrients, slope), the interpretation of aerial photographs of the present vegetation and topographic maps. Different stand types were determined based on a classification of site quality (three classes), slopes (four classes), and present forest structure (four strata). The effects of site quality on tree allometry (height-diameter curve, biomass allometry, leaf area) and growth (increment size) are incorporated into Formix 3-Q. We derived allometric relations and growth factors for different site conditions from the field data. Climax forest structure at the stand level was shown to depend strongly on site conditions. Simulated successional pattern and climax structure were compared with field observations. Based on the current management plan for the DFR, harvesting scenarios were simulated for stands on different sites. The effects of harvesting guidelines on forest structure and the implications for sustainable forest management at Deramakot were analyzed. Based on the stand types and GIS analysis, we also simulated undisturbed regeneration of the logged-over forest in the DFR at the FMU level. The simulations predict slow recovery rates, and regeneration times far exceeding 100 years.},

abstract = {Multiple agent-based models (ABM) on social-ecological systems exist in parallel investigating similar research questions. However, the choice of a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, model comparison is difficult because model descriptions are often incomplete, intransparent and difficult to understand. Therefore we expand and refine the ‘ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts, and Details) protocol to establish a standard to describe ABMs which includes human decision making (ODD+D). Since the original ODD is mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary for the social- ecological context. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. Furthermore, ODD+D encompasses a section on ‘Theoretical and empirical background' to encourage that model design and model assumptions are related more closely to theory. The application of ODD+D is illustrated with a description of a social-ecological ABM on water use. We believe that our expansions help to make the ODD protocol a most suitable protocol to describe social-ecological ABMs and may support the review process of related manuscripts. The ODD+D protocol does not only improve the quality of model descriptions but also improves our understanding of models and is an important necessary step forward developing theory respectively frameworks for social- ecological ABMs.},

abstract = {Several techniques have been developed to quantify the degree of embolism of the xylem using hydraulic conductance. Although there have been several improvements to these techniques, their reliability is still questionable and many technical pitfalls persist. We are proposing here a manometric approach to improve the accuracy of xylem cavitation measurement by the original air-injection technique which uses twigs exposed to pres- surized air to cause cavitation. The measured parameter is air bubble production (Pb) caused by xylem cavitation in birch (Betula pendula Roth) twigs from which the percent increase in bubble production is calculated to quantify xylem cavitation. Data produced by three different methods (bench-drying, air-injection, and manometric approach) are compared. Xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) constructed by the reference and reliable bench-drying technique and the manometric approach show similar sigmoid ‘‘S'' shape, but a small anomaly appeared in the VC constructed by the original air-injection technique. The xylem pressure inducing 50{\%} of embolism (P50) was the same with the three techniques. Furthermore, there was a strong positive correlation between the estimators of xylem cavitation measured by the three different methods. For its reliability, precision and ease we recommend the manometric tech- nique as an improved version of the original hydraulic air- injection method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.Ecosystem structures of tropical mountain forests are under threat due to changes in climate and land-use. The dry tropical montane forest of Munessa-Shashemene in south-east Ethiopia is a prominent example of degradation and deforestation in the sub-humid tropics. In recent years an increasing number of precipitation events has been observed, mainly during the short rainy season. Moreover, the recent IPCC Report envisages an increase in total annual precipitation, accompanied by more frequent extreme weather events (drought, torrential rains) for the Horn of Africa until the end of the 21st century.To evaluate possible consequences for local forest ecosystems, we applied the process-based, individual-oriented forest simulation model Formix3 to identify the influence of precipitation variability on the forest growth dynamics. We parameterised the model using field observation data including, for the first time, a tree-ring chronology of Croton macrostachyus. By using different levels of annual precipitation and intra-annual precipitation patterns, we analysed explicit simulation scenarios focussing on both overall and species-specific aboveground biomass dynamics and tree species composition.We found that the model reproduces aboveground biomass productivity precisely under current precipitation conditions. Variations in precipitation cause ecological shifts in the conditions for tree growth. Biomass and species richness both increase with mean annual precipitation, with the effects stabilising over time. Our results emphasise the impact of the duration and frequency of periods of water limitation on forest structure and growth.Our model has a variety of potential applications including investigation of the impacts of precipitation variability on forest structure and tree species diversity. It is thus a useful tool for extrapolating local growth measurements and succession, and analysing the impact of different management strategies on dry tropical montane forests.},

abstract = {The recent development of REDD+ mechanisms requires reliable estimation of carbon stocks, especially in tropical forests that are particularly threatened by global changes. Even though tree height is a crucial variable for computing aboveground forest biomass (AGB), it is rarely measured in large-scale forest censuses because it requires extra effort. Therefore, tree height has to be predicted with height models. The height and diameter of all trees over 10 cm in diameter were measured in 33 half-hectare plots and 9 one-hectare plots throughout northern French Guiana, an area with substantial climate and environmental gradients. We compared four different model shapes and found that the Michaelis–Menten shape was most appropriate for the tree biomass prediction. Model parameter values were significantly different from one forest plot to another, and this leads to large errors in biomass estimates. Variables from the forest stand structure explained a sufficient part of plot-to-plot variations of the height model parameters to improve the quality of the AGB predictions. In the forest stands dominated by small trees, the trees were found to have rapid height growth for small diameters. In forest stands dominated by larger trees, the trees were found to have the greatest heights for large diameters. The aboveground biomass estimation uncertainty of the forest plots was reduced by the use of the forest structure-based height model. It demonstrated the feasibility and the importance of height modeling in tropical forests for carbon mapping. When the tree heights are not measured in an inventory, they can be predicted with a height–diameter model and incorporating forest structure descriptors may improve the predictions.},

Measurements were made along three 250 m transects and adjacent to 95 seedlings on four logged or virgin plots of a French Guianese forest. Correlation analysis showed that more mobile and less expensive methods, such as the LAI metre and diazo paper metres, can provide similar information to more cumbersome or expensive equipment such as the LAI-2000 metre or hemispherical photographs. All instruments except the densiometre detected differences among seedlings from different post-logging microsites. Few significant correlations were found between light measures and the number of trees or their basal area within 10 m, which may reflect an increase in the density of smaller stems and lianas during post-logging succession. },

In this paper the rain forest growth model FORMIX3 is used for such a study. As main processes, the FORMIX3 model includes tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. Two different logging methods (conventional and low impact logging) in combination with different cutting cycles (from 20 to 100 years) were investigated for their long-term impact on the forest. We characterize the impacts with four indicators: total yield, yield per cut, species composition, and canopy opening. Our simulation results indicate that too short logging cycles ({\textless}40 years) overuse this forest. The corresponding yields are low and the species composition is highly disturbed. For conservation of species composition and minimizing erosion risk, logging cycles of 80 or 100 years in combination with low impact methods are recommended. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Our goals were to: (1) determine the spatial characteristics of canopy gap fraction immediately following selective logging in the eastern Amazon; (2) determine the degree and rate of canopy closure in early years following harvest among the major landscape features associated with logging - tree falls, roads, skid trails and log decks; and (3) quantify spatial and temporal differences in canopy opening and closure in high- and low-damage harvests (CL vs. RIL). Across a wide range of harvest intensities (2.6-6.4 felled trees ha(-1)), the majority of ground damage occurred as skid trails (4-12{\%}), whereas log decks and roads were only a small contributor to the total ground damage ({\textless}2{\%}). Despite similar timber harvest intensities, CL resulted in more ground damage than RIL. Neither the number of log decks nor their individual or total area was correlated with the number of trees removed or intensity of tree harvesting (trees ha(-1)). The area of skids was well correlated with the ground area damaged (m(2)) per tree felled. In recently logged forest (0.5 years postharvest), gap fractions were highest in log decks (mean RIL=0.83, CL=0.99) and lowest in tree-fall areas (RIL: 0.26, CL: 0.41). However, the small surface area of log decks made their contribution to the total area-integrated forest gap fraction minor. In contrast, tree falls accounted for more than two-thirds of the area disturbed, but the canopy gaps associated with felled trees were much smaller than for log decks, roads and skids. Canopy openings decreased in size with distance from each felled tree crown. At 0.5 years postharvest, the area initially affected by the felling of each tree was approximately 100 m in radius for CL and 50 m for RIL. Initial decreases in gap fraction during the first 1.5 years of regrowth diminished in subsequent years. Throughout the 3.5-year period of forest recovery, tree-fall gap fractions remained higher in CL than in RIL treatments, but canopy gap closure rates were higher in CL than in RIL areas. During the observed recovery period, the canopy gap area affected by harvesting decreased in radius around each felled tree from 100 to 40 m in CL, and from 50 to 10 m in RIL. The results suggest that the full spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy gap fraction must be understood and monitored to predict the effects of selective logging on regional energy balance and climate regimes, biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling, and plant and faunal population dynamics. This paper also shows that remote sensing of log decks alone will not provide an accurate assessment of total forest area impacted by selective logging, nor will it be closely correlated to damage levels and canopy gap closure rates.

abstract = {The significance of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra forests in Gredos mountain range in the Iberian botanical literature has been traditionally a matter of controversy. Considered for many botanists to be anthropogenic forests, a high amount of syntaxonomic approaches, cartographies of potential vegetation and dynamic models have been created based on this guesswork. Nevertheless, this work contributes new data that contradicts this previous hypothesis. For the first time, these data prove the existence of a bioclimatic belt where pine trees dominated during the last 6500 years, clarifying its altitudinal range, surface extension, and its stability. The study is based on the analysis of fossil macrorests and megarests, dated using radiocarbon. The results obtained cohere with the suggestions of other authors that assume the native character of P. nigra and P. sylvestris in this area, based on data of diverse origin (palynological, historical, toponymical, dendrochronological or geobotanical). The paper then continues to discuss the geobotanical interpretation of the results and the regional lines of management, as well as the potential causes that could have induced the marked decline of pine forests in the last millennia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Many tools available today are either designed for planning periods that are too short to consider long-term sustainability, omit important parts of the forest ecosystem or are not capable of considering environmental changes. A long-term potential growth-limiting factor is the supply of available base cations as was demonstrated in an earlier study for a research area in southern Sweden.

abstract = {Daily sap flow rate was determined in five Mediterranean species (Pinus halepensis, Quercus coccifera, Pistacia lentiscus, Erica multiflora, and Stipa tenacissima) under two slope aspects (north- and south-facing) in a semi-arid area (Alicante, SE Spain). Sap flow velocity was measured in January, May, August and October of two consecutive years (1998 and 1999) using the stem heat balance (SHB) method. Our results have demonstrated the effects of global radiation (R (g)), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on the sap flow velocity per unit of leaf area. Mean daily sap flow rates (Q (md)) showed values between 0.001 and 0.202 g H(2)O cm(-2) leaf area day(-1). Q (md) values were higher on the south-facing slope than on the north-facing slope. In most species, the Q (md) was higher in 1998 than in 1999 due to the higher soil water content, temperature and VPD in 1998. In all five species, a decrease in predawn leaf water potential was accompanied by a decrease in mean daily sap flow rates; nevertheless, the responses of the five species to water deficit conditions were different. In this context, we have linked the drought avoidance mechanisms of the different species through the combined use of daily sap flow rate and predawn leaf water potential under different water deficit conditions. We conclude that Pinus halepensis, Pistacia lentiscus and Erica multiflora show water-savers mechanisms to cope with drought, while Quercus coccifera and Stipa tenacissima show water-spenders mechanisms.},

Forest transitions have occurred in two, sometimes overlapping circumstances.

In other places a scarcity of forest products has prompted governments and landowners to plant trees in some fields. The transitions do little to conserve biodiversity, but they do sequester carbon and conserve soil, so governments should place a high priority on promoting them. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Lake Ashenge, a closed-basin lake near the northernmost penetration of summer monsoon rains, is well placed to provide a continental record of past changes in the strength of the African monsoon system. Diatom and oxygen isotope analyses of the lake sediments confirm that the overall trend of climate change during the past 17,000 years was driven by precessional forcing, punctuated by abrupt shifts that may be linked to changes in Atlantic surface temperatures. The lake level was low from at least 17.2 to 16.2 cal kyr BP, and then rose between 16.2 and 15.2 cal kyr BP, which may represent a temporary reactivation of the monsoonal circulation system following its reduced activity during the Last Glacial Maximum. The lake was significantly low between 13.6 and {\~{}} 11.8 cal kyr BP coinciding approximately with the Younger Dryas, but beginning 900 years before its recognised onset in the Greenland ice-core record. A major sedimentary hiatus, covering the interval {\~{}} 11.8 to 7.6 cal kyr BP, was probably caused by an early Holocene lowstand, the precise timing of which cannot be determined because pre-lowstand sediments were eroded from the core site. The lake filled to its overflow from 7.6 cal kyr BP until 5.6 cal kyr BP, when the sediments record an abrupt lake response to the regional transition to arid conditions that mark the end of African Humid Period. Evidence is also presented for climate changes which may have been associated with the rise and fall of Aksum, Ethiopia's first great civilisation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plants are often subjected to periods of soil and atmospheric water de{\textregistered}cit during their life cycle. The frequency of such phenomena is likely to increase in the future even outside today's arid/semi-arid regions. Plant responses to water scarcity are complex, involving deleterious and/or adaptive changes, and under {\textregistered}eld conditions these responses can be synergistically or antagonistically modi{\textregistered}ed by the superimposition of other stresses. This com- plexity is illustrated using examples of woody and herbaceous species mostly from Mediterranean-type eco- systems, with strategies ranging from drought-avoidance, as in winter/spring annuals or in deep-rooted perennials, to the stress resistance of sclerophylls. Differences among species that can be traced to different capacities for water acquisition, rather than to differences in metabolism at a given water status, are described. Changes in the root : shoot ratio or the temporary accumulation of reserves in the stem are accompanied by alterations in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, the {\textregistered}ne regulation of which is still largely unknown. At the leaf level, the dissipation of excitation energy through processes other than photosynthetic C-metabolism is an important defence mechanism under conditions of water stress and is accompanied by down-regulation of photo- chemistry and, in the longer term, of carbon metabolism.},

In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

abstract = {Multiproxy analyses were performed on core MS27PT recovered in hemipelagic sediments deposited on the Nile margin in order to reconstruct Nile River palaeohydrological fluctuations during the last 100,000 years. The strontium and neodymium isotope composition of the terrigenous fraction and the major element distribution reveal large and abrupt changes in source, oscillating between a dominant aeolian Saharan contribution during arid periods and a dominant Nile River contribution during pluvial periods. Iron content shows a strong correlation with strontium and neodymium isotopes. This allows the use of a high-resolution continuous Fe record as a proxy of Blue Nile sediment input over the last 100,000 years. The detailed Fe record, with approximately 10 years resolution during pluvial periods, is consistent with subtropical African records of well-dated lake level fluctuations and thus constitutes a first continuous high resolution record of the East African monsoon regime intensity over Ethiopia.The detailed Fe record shows the two main known pluvial periods attributed to strengthening of the African monsoon over Ethiopia, the Nabtian period from 14 to 8. ka cal BP and the Saharan period from 98 to 72. ka BP. For the first time, the last glacial period (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2, 3 and 4) is documented with a continuous record showing large oscillations between high and low East African palaeo-monsoon regimes.The end of the Nabtian period occurred at 8 ka in core MS27PT, i.e. much earlier than on the East Equatorial African region where it ended around 5.5. ka. We interpret this as evidence that the southward shift of the rain belt occurred 3000 years earlier over the Eastern Ethiopian Highland and propose that the gradual southward migration of the rain belt was associated with highly variable intensity and longer rainy seasons from 8 to 5. ka. During the last glacial period, two wet periods are present around 60-50. ka BP and 38-30. ka BP. These two humid periods are in phase with the rise of atmospheric CH4 concentrations suggesting that wetland tropical African area was one of the sources of the atmospheric CH4 during the MIS 3. During the Last Glacial Maximum and MIS 4, high Saharan aeolian influxes in phase with records of aeolian dust deposited in East Antarctica are documented. This study highlights the importance of reconstructions of monsoon rainfall fluctuation at high temporal resolution to better understand the link between low- and high-latitude climate variability at millennial timescales. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a strong global carbon sink over recent decades, with a substantial fraction of this sink probably located in the tropics, particularly in the Amazon. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.},

abstract = {Shifting cultivation is a traditional agricultural practice in most tropical regions of the world and has the potential to provide for human livelihoods while hosting substantial biodiversity. Little is known about the resilience of shifting cultivation to increasing agricultural demands on the landscape or to unexpected disturbances. To investigate these issues, we develop a simple social-ecological model and implement it with literature-derived ecological parameters for six shifting cultivation landscapes from three continents. Analyzing the model with the tools of dynamical systems analysis, we show that such landscapes exhibit two stable states, one characterized by high forest cover and agricultural productivity, and another with much lower values of these traits. For some combinations of agricultural pressure and ecological parameters both of these states can potentially exist, and the actual state of the forest depends critically on its historic state. In many cases, the landscapes' 'ecological resilience', or amount of forest that could be destroyed without shifting out of the forested stability domain, declined substantially at lower levels of agricultural pressure than would lead to maximum productivity. A measure of 'engineering resilience', the recovery time from standardized disturbances, was independent of ecological resilience. These findings suggest that maximization of short-term agricultural output may have counterproductive impacts on the long-term productivity of shifting cultivation landscapes and the persistence of forested areas.},

abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of species that basically depend on the same resources has been a brainteaser for generations of ecologists. Different mechanisms have been proposed to facilitate coexistence in plant communities, where space is an important resource. Using a stochastic cellular automaton simulation model we analyze - separately and in combination - the influence of different species traits and processes which alter local competition on the coexistence of plant species over a fixed time horizon. We show that different species traits operate on different time scales in competition. We therefore suggest the concept of weak versus strong traits according to short- or long-term exclusion of species differing in these traits. As a consequence, highly non-linear trade-offs between weak and strong traits can result in communities. Furthermore, we found that trade-offs based on physiological species traits such as plant lifetime, dispersal range and plant growth, did not support broad and long-term coexistence-further processes such as density-dependent mortality and light-dependent colonization were necessary. This suggests that coexistence in plant communities requires (stabilizing) local processes to support the (equalizing) trade-offs in species traits. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It is observed that in response to global warming, an asymmetric pattern develops between tropical precipitation changes in the northern and southern hemispheres, and this asymmetry is locked with the seasonal cycle of tropical convection. In boreal summer (winter), the northern hemispherical average departure from tropical mean increases (decreases), while the departure of the southern hemispherical average decreases (increases). This implies an enhanced seasonal precipitation range between rainy and dry seasons and an increased precipitation difference between northern and southern hemispheres.},

abstract = {Venezuela's logging history is poorly documented, although this country is endowed with one of the largest tracts of forests in Latin America. In this paper, we reviewed the history of natural forest management (NFM) in the western plains where commercial logging began as early as 1920. In the first few decades, logging was highly selective, focusing on mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and cedar (Cedrela odorata). From the 1950s until recent times, saqui-saqui (Bombacopsis quinata) was the most important timber species not only in the study area but also for all of Venezuela. Early logging was based on annual permits, resulting in the eventual conversion of natural forests into pasture. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Venezuelan government set aside four permanent forest estates (PFEs; covering ca. 1 Mio ha) in the study area to sustain timber production. However, NFM under long-term lease contracts (up to 40 years) did not commence until 1970. Conventional logging operations, removing all valuable timber species above the legal size, leave a highly damaged residual stand. Growth modelling suggests that the anticipated 30-yr cutting cycles do not provide sustainable yields under the current logging regime. On suitable sites, teak (Tectona grandis) is a promising species for monocultures. Due to the invasion of landless farmers, the area of PFEs has declined to some 250 000 ha (230 000 ha logged or unlogged forest, 20 000 ha monocultures). The remaining forest can only be preserved as timber production area if: (1) NFM is improved, (2) underpricing of forest resources is surmounted, and (3) disparity in land tenure and the trend to extensifying agriculture is overcome. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Managing tropical rain forests is difficult because few long-term field data on forest growth and the impact of harvesting disturbance are available. Growth models may provide a valuable tool for managers of tropical forests, particularly if applied to the extended forest areas of up to 100,000 ha that typically constitute the so-called forest management units (FMUs). We used a stand growth model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to simulate tropical rain forest growth at the FMU level. We applied the process-based rain forest growth model Formix 3-Q to the 55,000 ha Deramakot Forest Reserve (DFR) in Sabah, Malaysia. The FMU was considered to be composed of single and independent small-scale stands differing in site conditions and forest structure. Field data, which were analyzed with a GIS, comprised a terrestrial forest inventory, site and soil analyses (water, nutrients, slope), the interpretation of aerial photographs of the present vegetation and topographic maps. Different stand types were determined based on a classification of site quality (three classes), slopes (four classes), and present forest structure (four strata). The effects of site quality on tree allometry (height-diameter curve, biomass allometry, leaf area) and growth (increment size) are incorporated into Formix 3-Q. We derived allometric relations and growth factors for different site conditions from the field data. Climax forest structure at the stand level was shown to depend strongly on site conditions. Simulated successional pattern and climax structure were compared with field observations. Based on the current management plan for the DFR, harvesting scenarios were simulated for stands on different sites. The effects of harvesting guidelines on forest structure and the implications for sustainable forest management at Deramakot were analyzed. Based on the stand types and GIS analysis, we also simulated undisturbed regeneration of the logged-over forest in the DFR at the FMU level. The simulations predict slow recovery rates, and regeneration times far exceeding 100 years.},

Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year(-1), with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

abstract = {A new method called HF-densitometry is introduced, which measures relative density variations along wood surfaces utilizing the dielectric properties of wood. The method is based on the propagation of continu- ous electromagnetic waves in a high-frequency (HF) transmitter-receiver link of an extremely small electrode system, which is in direct contact with the wood surface investigated. The electromagnetic field emitted by the transmitting electrode propagates through a small volume of the wood sample to the receiving electrode, located very close to the trans- mitting electrode. The received signal strength is directly influenced by the dielectric properties of the material along the propagation path. The variation of the relative dielectric constant in different wood structures is correlated with the density variations in a way the received signal strength increases with increasing wood density. The dielectric measur- ing device, developed on the basis of the new method, allows non-de- structive, extremely fast measurements of wood density variations. The new HF-densitometry method was compared to X-ray densitometry by performing measurements on an identical spruce sample.},

abstract = {Tree-ring records are a valuable source of information for understanding long-term, regional-scale drought changes. In this study, a tree ring width chronology spanning the last 330 years (A.D. 1681-2010) is developed for the northern fringe of the Asian summer monsoon in north central China based on tree ring widths of the Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) at three sites in the Hasi Mountain (HSM). An annual (running from the previous August to the present July) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) series is reconstructed for the period A.D. 1698 to 2010 using a linear regression model. This reconstruction accounts for 49 {\%} of the actual PDSI variance during the calibration period (A.D.1951-2005). During the last past 330 years, the year 1759 drought was the most severe and the 1926-1932 drought was the most long-lasting. These drought episodes resulted in huge economic losses and severe famine. Similar periods of drought are also found in the Great Bend of the Yellow River region, northeastern Tibetan Plateau and northern China. Our drought reconstruction is consistent with the dry-wet index derived from historical documents for the Great Bend of the Yellow River region for the last three centuries, revealing that our annual PDSI reconstruction reflects broad-scale climate anomalies and represents drought variations in the northern fringe of the Asian summer monsoon. The PDSI reconstruction correlates significantly with sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean at an annual timescale, implying that El Nio-Southern Oscillation and the Indian monsoon might be influencing drought variability in the study area. Some extremely dry years of 1707, 1764, 1837, 1854, 1878, 1884, 1926 and 1932 coincided with major El Nio events in historical times. The decadal-scale variability is linked to Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and SST variations in the Atlantic Ocean. The observed recent tree growth reduction is unusual when viewed from a long-term perspective.},

abstract = {Sustainable forest management (SFM) represents a new paradigm for forestry. Traditional forestry objectives aimed at sustainable yield management are being replaced with those of a sustainable ecosystem management. This paradigm shift in forest management requires an effective transfer of results from researchers to forest managers. To predict the potential impacts of future changes in global environment (such as climate, land use, fire disturbance, and forest harvesting) on the sustainability of forest ecosystems, forest resource managers will require forest simulation models. There have been two basic approaches to modeling forest vegetation growth and dynamics: empirical and mechanistic forest simulation models. This paper reviews and compares three major types of forest simulation models: (1) growth and yield models (empirical approach); (2) succession models (empirical-mechanistic hybrid approach); and (3) process models (mechanistic approach), and describes three case studies as examples. The advantages and disadvantages of the different modeling approaches are discussed. The case studies deal with predicting future forest stocks under different management options, simulating the potential effects of climate change, and effects of fire disturbance on structure and function of forest ecosystems in Canada. There is still a gap between foresters and ecologists in developing and using forest simulation models. Diversified modeling approaches integrated into a decision-support system, which will become an important tool for evaluating the sustainability of forest ecosystem in a changing environment, is emphasized.

Each ring is assessed for narrowness compared with its immediate neighbours, and each narrow ring is represented on a linear plot as a line of increasing length proportional to its narrowness. A method is described for deriving these plots by computer, using a digital filter, running means and standard deviations of ring width measurements. Examples are given of manual and computer plots for 3 specimens from sensitive (Abies concolor from Nevada), moderate (Picea glauca from Labrador), and complacent (Larix occidentalis from British Columbia) sites. Agreement between manual and computer plots was 77-85{\%}. Program listings in FORTRAN are given for 2 subroutines, which identify the narrow rings and produce the plots.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mangrove Rhizophora mucronata has previously been reported to lack annual growth rings, thus barring it from dendrochronological studies. In this study the reported absence of the growth rings was reconsidered and the periodic nature of light and dark brown layers visible on polished stem discs investigated. In addition, the formation of these layers in relation to prevailing environmental conditions, as well as their potential for age determination of the trees, was studied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Trees of known age were collected and a 2.5-year cambial marking experiment was conducted to determine the periodic nature of the visible growth layers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Annual indistinct growth rings were detected in R. mucronata and are defined by a low vessel density earlywood and a high vessel density latewood. The formation of these growth rings and their periodic nature was independent from site-specific environmental conditions in two forests along the Kenyan coast. However, the periodic nature of the rings was seriously affected by slow growth rates, allowing accurate age determination only in trees with radial growth rates above 0.5 mm year(-1). The onset of the formation of the low vessel density wood coincided with the onset of the long rainy season (April-May) and continues until the end of the short rainy season (November). The high vessel density wood is formed during the dry season (December-March). Age determination of the largest trees collected in the two studied forests revealed the relatively young age of these trees (+/-100 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study reports, for the first time, the presence of annual growth rings in the mangrove R. mucronata, which offers further potential for dendrochronological and silvicultural applications.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are highly diverse ecosystems, but within such forests there can be large patches dominated by a single tree species. The myriad presumed mechanisms that lead to the emergence of such monodominant areas is currently the subject of intensive research. We used the most generic of these mechanisms, large seed mass and low dispersal ability of the monodominant species, in a spatially explicit model. The model represents seven identical species with long-distance dispersal of small seeds, competing with one potentially monodominant species with short-distance dispersal of large seeds. Monodominant patches emerged and persisted only for a narrow range of species traits; these results have the characteristic features of phase transitions. Additional mechanisms may explain monodominance in different ecological contexts, but our results suggest that percolation-like phenomena and phase transitions might be pervasive in this type of system.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) measured with fish-eye sensors is inevitably affected by slope. In order to quantify this effect, LAIs measured in contrasted forests were corrected for slope. Digitised hemispherical photographs were analysed to compute LAI according to azimuth and as a function of slope. The topographic mask (part of hemisphere obstructed by slope) and the path length of a ray of light at a given zenith angle (longer upslope and shorter downslope) were taken into account. Results indicate a strong slope effect, both in temperate conifer forest plantation and in tropical rain forest. On regular slope, this effect is easily corrected, although the topographic mask affects data. On irregular topography, corrected and uncorrected LAIs strongly differ, suggesting a need for reference measurements; corrected figures appear nevertheless realistic and normality is reached only for corrected values. LAIs should systematically be corrected for slope above 15-20??, more so if topography is irregular or the forest cover heterogeneous.

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

Interspecific differences in the homographic model parameters explain less than 7{\%} of the variation in chlorophyll content in our data set.

abstract = {Southem Tibet is intluenced by the Asian summer monsoon which causes 70-80{\%} of the annual precipitation to fall between June and August, showing a steep gradient from east to west. Teleconnections between the tree-ring chronologies of a sampling network have dem- onstrated a distinct dendroecological region in the catchment area of the Yarlung Tsangpo river, where tree growth is mainly limited by sum- mer precipitation. Ring width at these sites is strongly correlated to late summer (August to October) precipitation of the year prior to growth, indicating that the trees bear a high potential for the reconstruction of the rainfall variability at the northwestem fringe of the monsoonal re- gime. Light rings and other wood anatomical features like intra-annual growth bands can be observed in the westemmost stands of Pinus densa- ta . If these growth bands occur in the earlywood of the tree ring, they can be explained by cold events during spring; if they are Jocated in the transition zone between earlywood and Iatewood, they are caused by dry conditions during May and especially June, which points to a de- layed arrival ofthe moist monsoonal air masses in southern Tibet in the corresponding years.},

abstract = {Research was carried out on the wood formation process and the intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) trees from the coastal site of Guardamar, and inland Maigmo in south-eastern Spain. Samples taken at breast height of the trees were inspected to define the frequency of tree rings with latewood-like cells in earlywood (E-ring) and with earlywood-like cells in latewood (L-ring). L-rings were generally more frequent, especially on the warmer, dryer, coastal site of Guardamar. Dendrochronological techniques using tree-ring features vs. climate showed that L-rings were formed in Guardamar when August and/or September precipitation was higher than normal and in Maigmo when August precipitation was higher than normal. The formation of E-rings was promoted when winter and early spring were warmer than long term average. By studying intra-annual tree-ring formation at a cellular level, we found that at Maigmo in 2004 (MAI2004) all monitored trees presented a normal ring with normal earlywood and latewood and gradual transition between both. At Guardamar in 2005 (GUA2005) a typical L-ring was formed in the majority of monitored trees. In GUA2005 the wood formation started before February and the transition from early- to latewood occurred in late spring. In summer, the cambial cell production occurred at a very low rate, but an increased production of xylem cells took place in September when the amount of precipitation was twice as high as the long term average. During this period, a band of earlywood-like cells was formed, followed by the production of latewood-like cells that continued until the end of December. The normal ring in MAI2004 was formed because climatic factors triggering IADF did not occur (no precipitation in August 2004). After a modest cell production of cambium in September, only few latewood-like cells were produced. According to the strong agreement of results obtained from studying long-term dendrochronological series and intra-annual information on wood formation, such combined study indicates a high potential for use in explaining the environmental signals registered by a tree during different phases of wood formation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

However, research in dry tropical regions,$\backslash$nnotably those of sub-Saharan Africa, has remained fragmentary. Here,$\backslash$nwe try to identify the unique challenges and opportunities of dendrochronology$\backslash$nin the dry tropics. First, we briefly review the status of dendrochronology$\backslash$noutside temperate and boreal regions with an emphasis on sub-Saharan$\backslash$nAfrica. Subsequently, we focus upon one of those areas where dendrochronology$\backslash$nin the dry tropics is at the forefront of scientific advance: Ethiopia.$\backslash$nA detailed review of tree ring studies in the lowlands and highlands$\backslash$nhighlights the complexity of ring formation and made us identify$\backslash$nfour major types of growth ring expression: anatomically not distinct$\backslash$nrings, multiple rings per year, annual rings and multiple missing$\backslash$nrings.

abstract = {Sustainable use of species-rich moist forests is hampered by an insufficient under- standing of their dynamics and long-term response to different wood harvesting strategies. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of natural forest dynamics, explores the productivity of native forests subjected to different management strategies, and quantifies the ecological impacts of these strategies. The thesis focuses on two study regions: tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in central Veracruz, Mexico, and Valdivian temperate rain forest (VTRF) in northern Chilo{\'{e}} Island, Chile. The process-based forest growth model FORMIND is applied to study natural forest succession, to assess long-term ecological implications of fuelwood extraction on TMCF, to explore the potential of secondary TMCF for provision of ecosystem services and fuelwood, and to compare potential harvesting strategies for VTRF regarding forest productivity and ecological consequences. Simulation results show that both forest types have a high potential for wood production. As wood extraction increases, the forest structure becomes simplified because large old trees disappear from the forest. The species composition shifts to tree species that are favoured by the respective harvesting strategy. The overall ecological impact increases linearly with the amount of extracted wood. Simulation results allow to define management strategies that balance conservation and production objectives, promote the regeneration of desired tree species, or minimise shifts in the species composition of the forest. Process-based forest models enhance our understanding of the dynamics of species-rich moist forests and are indispensable tools to assess long-term implications of anthropogenic disturbances on forest ecosystems. Thereby they contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of native forests outside protected areas.},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({\textgreater}50. yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives.As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mountainous environment of the Ethiopian highlands has a great variety of ecotopes and thus demands great flexibility in land management. Different climatic conditions and landscape positions induce different soil forming processes, leading to various soil types with specific risks and potentials. The present study portrays a soil sequence of the central section of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, from the footslopes of the eastern escarpment to the marginal volcano structures. Six profiles under natural vegetation are described for classification according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy and World Reference Base for Soil Resources classification systems, and special site characteristics are discussed. The Acacia savannah of the footslopes (1900??m a. s. l.) is characterized by Vertisols (Mazic Vertisols/Aridic Haplusterts), with often pronounced effects of seasonal waterlogging. All other soils are well-drained and reflect the general increase in rainfall with elevation and slope, causing a decline in topsoil pH and a change from cation-rich clay soils of the Podocarpus-dominated forest at 2300??m a. s. l. (Mollic Nitisols/Typic Palehumults) to strongly-leached Humic Umbrisols/Humic Dystrudepts of the Hagenia-dominated forest around 2600??m a. s. l. The highland savannah plain (2700??m a. s. l.) with a drier and cooler environment has typically Mollic Cambisols/Dystric Haplustepts, which are less leached and have a rather brownish colour. At 2900??m a. s. l., Niti-umbric Alisols/Andic Hapludalfs are found in the Hypericum forest at the midslopes of the marginal volcanoes receiving high rainfall, whereas soil development is at a more initial state in the Erica-dominated forest at 3200??m a. s. l. (Umbric Andosols/Alic Hapludands). Clay mineral composition is kaolinite-dominated for the upper five profiles, with a high proportion of poorly crystalline components in the upper savannah and the volcano upslopes. The lowermost profile probably has a polygenetic origin indicated by an abrupt change from a smectitic to a kaolinitic composition in the subsoil. Soil development on quite homogeneous bedrock appears essentially controlled by relief and climate, underlining the suitability of the region as a model area for in-depth gradient studies on ecosystem processes and land use. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Plantations of exotic trees on areas where tropical forest has been clear-felled have been reported to facilitate regrowth of indigenous tree species. This so-called nurse- or shelter tree effect was investigated in a montane semihumid site in southern Ethiopia where plantations of Pinus patula and Eucalyptus saligna grow in close vicinity to the natural Podocarpus falcatus mixed forest. Physiological performance of P. falcatus saplings growing in the exotic and the natural forests was investigated over the year. Compared with the natural forest, photosynthetic carbon gain and growth of the saplings were significantly enhanced under Pinus patula while likewise retarded under Eucalyptus saligna. Diverging effects of the differently dense shelter canopies on the saplings could be traced to differences in the sub-canopy microclimates and particularly to the intensities and temporal distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Moisture also played an important role for photosynthetic carbon gain: while the morning patterns of CO 2 uptake were significantly correlated with the patterns of sunflecks, stomatal conductance was the determinant factor in the afternoon. Analysis of the photosynthetic efficiency of sunflecks revealed a lower quantum yield than the basic diffuse PAR intensity. Compared with a theoretically even distribution of the daily PAR, CO 2 uptake under the real light climate was 70{\%} under Pinus and in the natural forest, and 59{\%} under Eucalyptus. Relating growth rates of Podocarpus saplings to photosynthesis the microclimate under Pinus was 2. 5 times as effective as that in the natural forest and five times more effective than under Eucalyptus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Regeneration of seven indigenous tree species having significant ecological and economic importance was investigated in the Munessa-Shashemene dry Afromontane forest (MSF), southern Ethiopia. Densities and distributions of seedlings, saplings and trees were assessed along gradients of altitude, light and disturbance using quadrat sizes of 10??5 m (for seedlings) and 20??20 m (saplings and trees) following line transects. The number of individuals, frequency and height of the study species were recorded in the quadrats at every 100 m drop in altitude. Seedling densities varied markedly among the species and altitudes. Mean densities (number of individuals ha-1) of seedlings ranged from zero (Polyscias fulva) to 5334 (Prunus africana), and from three (Polyscias fulva) to 102 (Podocarpus falcatus) for trees and saplings. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that seedlings of Celtis africana and Croton macrostachyus were highly favored by disturbance and, hence, were concentrated in canopy gaps within the forest. Based on their population structures, the study species could be categorized into three groups: (1) Species that showed the highest proportion of individuals in the lowest height class and with a gradual decrease towards the upper height classes, which suggests good regeneration; Podocarpus falcatus, C. africana, C. macrostachys and P. africana belonged to this group. (2) Species that showed higher proportions of individuals in the lowest height class and with missing individuals in the subsequent middle height classes, indicative of hampered regeneration; Syzygium guineense and Pouteria adolfi-friederici belonged to this group. (3) Species with no individuals in the lowest and middle height classes but represented by individuals in upper height classes; P. fulva belonged to this group. The species categorized in the last two groups exhibited hampered regeneration, and P. fulva is in the verge of local extermination. High seedling densities (e.g. C. africana and P. africana) and/or adaptive defense mechanisms to herbivory (e.g. P. falcatus and C. macrostachyus) were common attributes of species, which exhibited good regeneration. Regeneration problems were largely attributed to human disturbance, lack of suitable habitat for seed germination or problems associated to seed set (seed predation or abortion). Our study indicated that P. fulva, P. adolfi-friederici and S. guineense require the highest immediate attention for conservation in the MSF. ?? 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deforestation contributes 6–17{\%} of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere1. Large uncertainties in emission estimates arise from inadequate data on the carbon density of forests2 and the regional rates of deforestation. Consequently there is an urgent need for improved data sets that characterize the global distribution of aboveground biomass, especially in the tropics. Here we use multi-sensor satellite data to estimate aboveground live woody vegetation carbon density for pan-tropical ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. Results indicate that the total amount of carbon held in tropical woody vegetation is 228.7Pg C, which is 21{\%} higher than the amount reported in the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 (ref. 3). At the national level, Brazil and Indonesia contain 35{\%} of the total carbon stored in tropical forests and produce the largest emissions from forest loss. Combining estimates of aboveground carbon stocks with regional deforestation rates4 we estimate the total net emission of carbon from tropical deforestation and land use to be 1.0PgCyr−1 over the period 2000–2010—based on the carbon bookkeeping model. These new data sets of aboveground carbon stocks will enable tropical nations to meet their emissions reporting requirements (that is, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Tier 3) with greater accuracy.},

abstract = {The present study examines the manner in which several whole-tree water transport properties scale with species-specific variation in sapwood water storage capacity. The hypothesis that constraints on relationships between sapwood capacitance and other water relations characteristics lead to predictable scaling relationships between intrinsic capacitance and whole-tree behaviour was investigated. Samples of sapwood from four tropical forest canopy tree species selected to represent a range of wood density, tree size and architecture, and taxonomic diversity were used to generate moisture release curves in thermocouple psychrometer chambers, from which species-specific values of sapwood capacitance were calculated. Sapwood capacitance was then used to scale several whole-tree water transport properties determined from measurements of upper branch and basal sap flow, branch water potential, and axial and radial movement of deuterated water (D2O) injected into the base of the trunk as a tracer. Sapwood capacitance ranged from 83 to 416 kg m(-3) MPa-1 among the four species studied and was strongly correlated with minimum branch water potential, soil-to-branch hydraulic conductance, daily utilization of stored water, and axial and radial movement of D2O. The species-independent scaling of several whole-tree water transport properties with sapwood capacitance indicated that substantial convergence in plant function at multiple levels of biological organization was revealed by a simple variable related to a biophysical property of water transport tissue.},

abstract = {Combined delta(13)C and delta(18)O analyses of leaf material were used to infer changes in photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and stomatal conductance (g(l)) in Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies trees growing under natural and controlled conditions. Correlation between g(l) and delta(18)O in leaf cellulose (delta(18)O(cel)) allowed us to apply a semi-quantitative model to infer g(l) from delta(18)O(cel) and also interpret variation in delta(13)C as reflecting variation in A(max). Extraction of leaf cellulose was necessary, because delta(18)O from leaf organic matter (delta(18)O(LOM)) and delta(18)O(cel) was not reliably correlated. In juvenile trees, the model predicted elevated carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to reduce A(max) in both species, whereas ozone (O(3)) only affected beech by reducing CO(2) uptake via lowered g(l). In adult trees, A(max) declined with decreasing light level as g(l) was unchanged. O(3) did not significantly affect isotopic signatures in leaves of adult trees, reflecting the higher O(3) susceptibility of juvenile trees under controlled conditions. The isotopic analysis compared favourably to the performance of leaf gas exchange, underlining that the semi-quantitative model approach provides a robust way to gather time-integrated information on photosynthetic performance of trees under multi-faced ecological scenarios, in particular when information needed for quantitative modelling is only scarcely available.},

abstract = {In the Jurassic, the Caucasus, presently located in the southwest of Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, was located on the northern active margin of the Neotethys Ocean. Facies interpretation in all 62 areas, distinguished by differences in facies, allows to semi-quantitatively evaluate Jurassic regional transgressions and regressions for this region. Major transgressive regressive cycles took place in the Hettangian-Aalenian, Bajocian-Bathonian and Callovian-Tithonian. Each transgression was more extensive than the previous. The same cycles are established in the Greater Caucasus Basin. Deep-marine environments were common in the Pliensbachian, late Aalenian and late Bathonian, whereas they were very restricted in the Late Jurassic. The Jurassic transgressions and regressions in the Caucasus coincided with the proposed global eustatic changes. However, some differences were caused by the regional tectonic activity. Although transgressions and regressions cause some changes in marine biodiversity, it seems that only ammonites might have been directly influenced by them. Diversity of bivalves, brachiopods and belemnites was driven by other factors. However, global changes in marine biodiversity were more closely related to the eustatic fluctuations than it was documented on a regional scale. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The detrendeR uses a simple and familiar dialog-box interface and it can read Tucson decadal-format files (*.rwl and *.crn) as well as plain text files. In addition, detrendeR has the ability to test temporal changes of the common signal using moving intervals.

abstract = {Tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the species may provide valuable information about tree-growth response to changes on climatic conditions. We established nine Pinus nigra, 12 P. sylvestris and 17 P. uncinata tree-ring width chronologies along the eastern and northern Iberian Peninsula, where these species are found at the edge of their natural range. Tree-growth variability was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) for the period 1885-1992. Despite the diversity of species, habitats and climatic regimes, a common macroclimatic signal expressed by the first principal component (PC1) was found. Moreover, considering the PC1 scores as a regional chronology, significant relations were established with Spanish meteorological data. The shared variance held by the tree chronologies, the frequency of narrow rings and the interannual growth variability (sensitivity) increased markedly during the studied period. This shows an enhancement of growth synchrony among forests indicating that climate might have become more limiting to growth. Noticeably, an upward abrupt shift in common variability at the end of the first half of the 20th century was detected. On the other hand, moving-interval response functions showed a change in the growth-climate relationships during the same period. The relationship between growth and late summer/autumn temperatures of the year before growth (August- September, negative correlation, and November, positive correlation) became stronger. Hence, water stress increase during late summer previous to tree growth could be linked to the larger growth synchrony among sites, suggesting that climate was driving the growth pattern changes. This agrees with the upward trend in temperature observed in these months. Moreover, the higher occurrence of extreme years and the sensitivity increase in the second half of the 20th century were in agreement with an increment in precipitation variability during the growing period. Precipitation variability was positively related to tree-growth variability, but negatively to radial growth. In conclusion, a change in tree-growth pattern and in the climatic response of the studied forests was detected since the mid-20th century and linked to an increase in water stress. These temporal trends were in agreement with the observed increase in warmer conditions and in precipitation variability. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Plantations of exotic trees on areas where tropical forest has been clear-felled have been reported to facilitate regrowth of indigenous tree species. This so-called nurse- or shelter tree effect was investigated in a montane semihumid site in southern Ethiopia where plantations of Pinus patula and Eucalyptus saligna grow in close vicinity to the natural Podocarpus falcatus mixed forest. Physiological performance of P. falcatus saplings growing in the exotic and the natural forests was investigated over the year. Compared with the natural forest, photosynthetic carbon gain and growth of the saplings were significantly enhanced under Pinus patula while likewise retarded under Eucalyptus saligna. Diverging effects of the differently dense shelter canopies on the saplings could be traced to differences in the sub-canopy microclimates and particularly to the intensities and temporal distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Moisture also played an important role for photosynthetic carbon gain: while the morning patterns of CO 2 uptake were significantly correlated with the patterns of sunflecks, stomatal conductance was the determinant factor in the afternoon. Analysis of the photosynthetic efficiency of sunflecks revealed a lower quantum yield than the basic diffuse PAR intensity. Compared with a theoretically even distribution of the daily PAR, CO 2 uptake under the real light climate was 70{\%} under Pinus and in the natural forest, and 59{\%} under Eucalyptus. Relating growth rates of Podocarpus saplings to photosynthesis the microclimate under Pinus was 2. 5 times as effective as that in the natural forest and five times more effective than under Eucalyptus. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

For years, ecological science has shown how large scale forest clearings cause declines in biodiversity and the availability of forest products. Yet some important changes in the rainforests, and in the ecosystem services they provide, have been underappreciated until recently. Emerging research indicates that land use in the Amazon goes far beyond clearing large areas of forest; selective logging and other canopy damage is much more pervasive than once believed. Deforestation causes collateral damage to the surrounding forests - through enhanced drying of the forest floor, increased frequency of fires, and lowered productivity. The loss of healthy forests can degrade key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance and river flow, the modulation of regional climate patterns, and the amelioration of infectious diseases. We review these newly revealed changes in the Amazon rainforests and the ecosystem services that they provide.},

Due to a greater availability of distribution data, methodological advances, and software tools, important progress has been made during the last decade to map broad-scale geographic gradients of plant species richness and endemism at continental to global scales. In this paper, we provide an overview about recent advances made in this field. We present studies that analyze global-scale diversity patterns of gymnosperms and all vascular plants.

Three study sites were selected along an altitudinal gradient (650, 1,100 and 1,600 m a.s.l.), and cambial activity rates of cell formation and cell maturation were studied on micro-cores collected in intervals of 10-20 days. The cambium reactivation of the low-altitude (L) and mid-altitude (M) trees occurred contemporaneously in late March, and also the consecutive phases of cell differentiation took place almost at the same time; however, the entry into cambial dormancy varied considerably from late August to mid-November. Due to lower temperature, the upper-altitude (U) trees showed a 10-day delay in their cambium reactivation, an earlier entry into cambium dormancy (mid-September) and a slower growth rate resulting in narrower tree rings. Despite these differences, the daily increment rates of the trees at all sites reached maximum values coincidently in the early June. Since the photoperiod is the only common external factor among different sites, it is concluded that the timing of the highest growth rate is controlled by the photoperiod.},

abstract = {Secondary forests are a major terrestrial carbon sink and reliable estimates of their carbon stocks are pivotal for understanding the global carbon balance and initiatives to mitigate CO2 emissions through forest management and reforestation. A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. AGB estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot AGB, including wood specific gravity (WSG) in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level AGB estimates substantially, while including WSG had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape AGB varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate AGB estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). 5. Functional traits explained 19-42{\%} of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

abstract = {This study aimed to correlate logging intensity with canopy opening using medium-resolution satellite images (SPOT-type) on a sample of 15 blocks totaling more than 3300ha in two French Guianan forests with different reliefs. The maps obtained show the cumulative impacts on the canopy over the entire logging period (2008-2010). The percentages of canopy openness and the unit areas per logged tree were examined with logging statistics and GPS mappings of felled stems for 4 sub-samples. At the block scale, a 20{\%} canopy opening after logging was observed for a logging intensity of 3.5treesha-1. The average canopy opening size per harvested tree was 601m2, which included felling gaps and openings resulting from the construction of roads and trails needed to remove the timber. The coefficients of variation of these variables were low. General linear models (glm) were created to test the relationship between canopy damage, logging intensity and relief at local scales (1 and 4ha) and at the management unit scale (i.e. 200-300ha). The model created at management-unit level (block level) did not detect any significant effect of the variables on the percentage of canopy openness. However, a significant and concordant relationship was demonstrated at local levels between relief, logging intensity, their interaction on the one hand and the percentage of canopy openness on the other. A maximum local harvesting intensity of 8 trees per hectare on plateaus makes it possible to obtain an opening of less than 33{\%} at an 85{\%} probability threshold. In contrast, the same canopy openness threshold is obtained at only 5 trees per hectare on hillier terrain, which suggests that it would be advantageous to adjust silviculture recommendations according to forest landscape. The average openness of 20{\%} observed in this sample, considered in relation to the cutting cycle in effect in French Guiana (65years), implies a complete renewal of forest stands after 325years, assuming multifunctional management objectives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {How tropical tree species respond to disturbance is a central issue of forest ecology, conservation and resource management. We define a hierarchical model to investigate how functional traits measured in control plots relate to the population change rate and to demographic rates for recruitment and mortality after disturbance by logging operations. Population change and demographic rates were quantified on a 12-year period after disturbance and related to seven functional traits measured in control plots. The model was calibrated using a Bayesian Network approach on 53 species surveyed in permanent forest plots (37.5 ha) at Paracou in French Guiana. The network analysis allowed us to highlight both direct and indirect relationships among predictive variables. Overall, 89{\%} of interspecific variability in the population change rate after disturbance were explained by the two demographic rates, the recruitment rate being the most explicative variable. Three direct drivers explained 45{\%} of the variability in recruitment rates, including leaf phosphorus concentration, with a positive effect, and seed size and wood density with negative effects. Mortality rates were explained by interspecific variability in maximum diameter only (25{\%}). Wood density, leaf nitrogen concentration, maximum diameter and seed size were not explained by variables in the analysis and thus appear as independent drivers of post-disturbance demography. Relationships between functional traits and demographic parameters were consistent with results found in undisturbed forests. Functional traits measured in control conditions can thus help predict the fate of tropical tree species after disturbance. Indirect relationships also suggest how different processes interact to mediate species demographic response.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is revolutionizing the way we study forests, and recent technological advances mean we are now able – for the first time – to identify and measure the crown dimensions of individual trees from airborne imagery. Yet to make full use of these data for quantifying forest carbon stocks and dynamics, a new generation of allometric tools which have tree height and crown size at their centre are needed. Here, we compile a global database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we develop general allometric models for estimating both the diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which can be remotely sensed – specifically height and crown diameter. We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across the world's forests. These new allometric models provide an intuitive way of integrating remote sensing imagery into large-scale forest monitoring programmes and will be of key importance for parameterizing the next generation of dynamic vegetation models.},

Using simple physical principles and empirically derived relationships, SERA provides an analytical venue to test alternative hypotheses about individual functional traits governing ecological or evolutionary processes at the population or community level of complexity. Our analyses show that, as a result of competition for light and space, individual-level features scale up to produce species ensemble properties such as the scaling of self-thinning, size-dependent mortality, realistic size-frequency distributions, and a broad spectrum of empirically observed relationships for the species examined. SERA also predicts the competitive exclusion of conifers by angiosperms and the age at which reproductive maturity is achieved by different species. SERA serves as a null hypothesis by demonstrating that biologically complex phenomena, including widely observed scaling relationships at the species-ensemble level, can emerge from the operation of simple and transparent "rules" governing competition for space and light.},

A total of 25 forest stands in the neighbourhood of 25 gaps in an enrichment planting experiment were assessed. A plot of dimension 30 × 30 m was established in each stand. Diameter at breast height (dbh) and height of all trees with dbh {\textgreater} 2 cm were measured. Regeneration of woody plants was assessed in four subplots in each stand. Thirty-six woody species were recorded in the mature stand, representing 35 genera and 30 families. Density of woody species was 734 stems ha-1 and the total basal area was 9.5 m2 ha-1. Regeneration of trees and shrubs was 1,000 saplings and 31,600 seedlings ha-1. Enrichment of valuable tree species with supplement plantings may be required to keep the valuable species as part of these forests.

abstract = {1. The existence of many types of monodominant forests is readily explainable by ecological theory (e.g. early successional forests). Nevertheless, monodominant stands sometimes occur in areas where a much higher diversity typically occurs. Such 'classical monodominance' is not currently readily explained by ecological theory. 2. We briefly review the published mechanisms suggested to cause classical monodominance and then combine them into a new probabilistic conceptual framework to better understand why these systems occur. We build on two theories proposed to explain monodominance: a lack of exogenous disturbance over long periods and species-spceific life-history traits. We suggest that certain traits under certain conditions may generate positive feedbacks leading to a greater probability of monodominance being achieved. Such positive feedbacks have the potential to drive a typically diverse system towards a monodominant one. 3. Synthesis. Classical monodominance in tropical forests is hypothesized to be attained when a group of traits occur together under low exogenous disturbance conditions, this giving rise to a series of positive feedbacks. The presented framework links the differing mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain classical monodominance and shows there are potentially alternative routes to monodominance, thus reconciling apparently contradictory observational and experimental results.},

abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},

abstract = {In the coming decades, a large fraction of the world's tropical forests will be fragmented into remnants surrounded by secondary vegetation, land-use areas, or roads. It is important to develop integrative tools to monitor the evolution of these fragmented ecosystems. We used the individual-oriented and process-based forest growth simulator FORMIND2.0 to investigate the spatial and temporal effects on standing biomass and functional diversity of various intensities and patterns of fragmentation within a forest landscape. The simulator was calibrated for an old-growth wet forest in French Guiana, South America. We found that the standing biomass of forest remnants was reduced significantly compared to a similar area of nonfragmented forest. When fewer but larger remnants were created rather than many small ones, the total loss in biomass and the increase in the abundance of early-successional species were significantly reduced, confirming that edge effects dominate the functioning of forest remnants. We also performed simulations of secondary succession after the landscape had been abandoned. The simulated recovery time in those secondary forests depends on both the size of cleared area and the spatial pattern of the remnant forests},

An application on woody logs of 2-year-old Populus× canadensis M{\"{o}}nch 'I-214' during tree-ring formation is reported. Samples are freeze-dried in liquid nitrogen and, successively, the bark is removed. After drying, the breaks between bark and xylem take place in correspondence of differentiating xylem cells. The cambial region with the differentiating phloem and xylem is gently scraped with a razor blade from the inner side of the bark and the outermost side of the stem, respectively. Additionally the mature xylem is milled until obtaining a powder. The amount of the cambial region collected by scraping changes with respect to the width of the differentiating zone (differentiating phloem and xylem), with higher amount of dry matter obtained during the maximum rate of xylem formation and high stem water content. After extraction of the powder in an ethanol solution and centrifugation, the supernatant and the resulting pellet are used for assessing the contents of non structural carbohydrates (NSC) and starch, respectively. NSC are determined using the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis and starch by colorimetric method. In both cambial region and xylem, the major NSC are glucose and fructose which represented together more than 80{\%} of the total NSC during wood formation. However, the total NSC are higher in cambial region compared to xylem, especially when the xylem and phloem are differentiating. The scraping technique provides the possibility to sample cambial region during the year, allowing the investigation of metabolic changes during tree-ring formation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Differential growth response to light level is widely accepted as a potential mechanism for maintaining tree species richness in tropical forests. The position of tree species in the hierarchy of the canopy is considered an important indicator of species light capture and growth strategy. Paradoxically, the relative importance of species identity and competition for light in determining individual tree growth is poorly documented at the adult stage. In this study, we used a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the overall importance of species identity, light and belowground competition as determinants of tree growth in French Guiana tropical forest. Light competitive status is assessed by a crown exposure score and below ground competition is estimated from local crowding. We examined species sensitivity to both types of competition in relation to adult stature. Our results are based on annual diameter increments of more than 13,510 stems from 282 species monitored over 10years. Mean annual growth rate was 0.11cmy-1 with species identity explaining 35{\%} of the individual variation in growth rate. Crown exposure and local crowding explained 3.5{\%} and 2.4{\%} of the variation in growth rate, respectively. Predicted changes in growth rate as crown exposure (resp. local crowding) index changed from lower to upper interquartile level was 0.03cmy-1 (resp. 0.02cmy-1). Species sensitivity to crown exposure and to local crowding were positively correlated (i) with predicted growth rate at high-light standardized conditions and (ii) with adult stature.This vertical niche partitioning is invoked to explain the limited contribution made by level of light competition for predicting individual tropical tree growth as the community-level response is dominated by the abundance of small-statured species with low sensitivity to light level.Light appears to drive the stem growth rate of tropical trees through species differentiation more than through individual tree growth limitation. This vertical stratification complements the previously reported regeneration niche and together these provide evidence for light niche partitioning in the three-dimensional space of tropical forests. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Recent studies have documented shifts in habitat associations of single tropical tree species from one life stage to the next. However, the community-level consequences of such shifts have not been investigated, and it is not clear whether they would amplify, neutralize or completely alter habitat structuring during the transitions to the adult community. 2. We compared habitat-driven species assemblages at three life stages (i.e. recruitment, juvenile and reproductive stages) and six censuses for tree and shrub species in a fully censused 50-ha plot of Panamanian lowland forest. Habitat types were determined using multivariate regression trees that group areas with similar species composition (i.e. species assemblages) according to their topographical characteristics. 3. Three topographical variables (a topographical wetness index, slope and elevation) were major determinants of species assemblages. When analysing individuals of all life stages together, we found a distinct and temporally consistent structuring of the plot into four dominant habitat types (low and high plateaus, slope and swamp) which was consistent with previous classifications. Basically, the same habitat structuring emerged for the juvenile communities of individual censuses. However, recruits showed a weak and temporally inconsistent habitat structuring. 4. A notable homogenization in species assemblages occurred during the transition from juvenile to reproductive, through both a reduction in the number of species assemblages (in 3 censuses, one large reproductive assemblage covered 93{\%} of the plot, and in others, an additional slope habitat emerged) and a reduction in the classification error. Overall, habitat structuring became noisier and weaker over the 25 years of the study. 5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that mortality processes during the transition from recruits to juveniles must enhance the signal of habitat structuring. However, during the transition to the reproductive stage, species may have lost the advantage of being in the habitat with which they had become associated, or the quality of habitat changed during their life span because of larger climatic changes. The homogeneous assemblages of the reproductive stage could be interpreted as support for neutral theories, but further research is required to unravel the mechanisms behind these intriguing observations.},

abstract = {Numerous grassland experiments have found evidence for a complementarity effect, an increase in productivity with higher plant species richness due to niche parti- tioning. However, empirical tests of complementarity in natural forests are rare. We con- ducted a spatially explicit analysis of 518 433 growth records for 274 species from a 50- ha tropical forest plot to test neighborhood complementarity, the idea that a tree grows faster when it is surrounded by more dissimilar neighbors. We found evidence for complemen- tarity: focal tree growth rates increased by 39.8{\%} and 34.2{\%} with a doubling of neigh- borhood multi- trait dissimilarity and phylogenetic dissimilarity, respectively. Dissimilarity from neighbors in maximum height had the most important effect on tree growth among the six traits examined, and indeed, its effect trended much larger than that of the multi- trait dissimilarity index. Neighborhood complementarity effects were strongest for light- demanding species, and decreased in importance with increasing shade tolerance of the focal individuals. Simulations demonstrated that the observed neighborhood complemen- tarities were sufficient to produce positive stand- level biodiversity–productivity relationships. We conclude that neighborhood complementarity is important for productivity in this tropical forest, and that scaling down to individual- level processes can advance our un- derstanding of the mechanisms underlying stand- level biodiversity–productivity relationships.},

abstract = {A hydrological modelling at a catchment scale has been used to investigate the impact of climatic and land use change on water resources in data scarce Tropical Africa using a distributed precipitation-runoff modelling system. The model divides a catchment into homogeneous hydrological response units, providing the ability to impose changes in climate or land use spatially. Model parameters were either estimated from different existing data or by calibration against measured discharge data available over 11 years (1985-1995). The model simulation-period was divided into calibration (1986-1990) and validation (1991-1995) periods. The model provided relatively good fits between measured and simulated discharge both at a daily and monthly scales. Based on sensitivity analyses, a 10{\%} decrease in rainfall produced a 30{\%} reduction on the simulated hydrologic response of the catchment, while a 1.5°C increase in air temperature would result in a decrease in the simulated discharge of about 15{\%}. Converting the present day dominantly cultivated/grazing land in the studied river basin by woodland would decrease the discharge at the outlet by about 8{\%}. In order to use the results of this kind of model for decision making and water resources management, the model should be tested under different environment and different scenario conditions. Rainfall measurement and stage-discharge rating curves should be given priority to improve model performance. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sap flow continued throughout the night during the dry season and contributed from 13 to 28{\%} of total daily transpiration. During the dry season, psiL was substantially less negative in covered transpiring leaves, throughout the day and night, than in exposed leaves. Before dawn, differences in psiL between covered and exposed leaves were about 0.4 MPa. When relationships between sap flow and psiL of exposed leaves were extrapolated to zero flow, the resulting values of psiL (a proxy of weighted mean soil water potential) in two of the species were similar to predawn values of covered leaves. Consistent with substantial nocturnal sap flow, stomatal conductance (gs) never dropped below 40 mmol m(-2) s(-1) at night, and in some cases, rose to as much as 100 mmol m(-2) s(-1) before the end of the dark period. Nocturnal gs decreased linearly with increasing air saturation deficit (D), but there were species-specific differences in the slopes of the relationships between nocturnal gs and D. Withdrawal and recharge of water from stem storage compartments were assessed by monitoring diel fluctuations of stem diameter with electronic dendrometers. Stem water storage compartments tended to recharge faster when nocturnal transpiration was reduced by covering the entire plant. Water potential of covered leaves did not stabilize in any of the plants before the end of the dark period, suggesting that, even in covered plants, water storage tissues were not fully rehydrated by dawn. Patterns of sap flow and expansion and contraction of stems reflected the dynamics of water movement during utilization and recharge of stem water storage tissues. This study showed that nighttime transpiration and recharge of internal water storage contribute to predawn disequilibrium in water potential between leaves and soil in neotropical savanna woody plants.},

abstract = {Old-growth forest ecosystems comprise a mosaic of patches in different successional stages, with the fraction of the landscape in any particular state relatively constant over large temporal and spatial scales. The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass⋅ha(-1)⋅y(-1) were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a sawtooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO(2) fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9{\%} of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.},

Especially in combination with the ongoing tree harvesting in this region the recruitment threat imposes a severe danger on the species richness and forest structure of the whole area. We here assess with the process-based forest growth model FORMIND2.0 the impacts of common tree-logging strategies in those recruitment endangered forests. FORMIND2.0 is based on the calculations of the carbon balance of individual trees belonging to 13 different plant functional types. Even single logging events in those rainforests threatened by a lack of recruitment led to shifts in the abundances of species, to species loss, and to forest decline and dieback. The results show that current logging practices in South-East Asia seriously overuse the forests especially in the light of changing climate conditions},

                        2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances ($\Delta$C 
                        soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R 
                        floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R 
                        het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of $\Delta$C 
                        soil has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, $\Delta$C 
                        soil was calculated by subtracting R 
                        het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R 
                        floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.The R 
                        het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R 
                        floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.In our opinion, the R 
                        het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO 
                        2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R 
                        floor method. As the estimation of $\Delta$C 
                        soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there is insufficient information to reconstruct past changes in climate and to evaluate the implications of future climate changes on the vegetation. Tree-ring analysis is a powerful tool for studying tree age, population dynamics, growth behavior, and climate-growth relationships among tropical tree species and for gaining information about the environmental forces driving growth change as well as for developing proxies for climate reconstruction. Wood anatomical and dendrochronological methods were used on Juniperus procera trees from two Ethiopian highland forests to check (i) whether tree-ring series of juniper are cross-datable and hence suitable for building tree-ring chronologies, and if so, (ii) which climate factors mainly drive wood formation in juniper from this region. Visible growth layers of the juniper wood were shown to be annual rings. Tree-ring sequences could be cross-dated between trees growing at the same site and between trees growing at sites 350 km apart. Evidence was found that annual growth of junipers is mainly controlled by one climatic factor, precipitation. This strong precipitation influence proves the potential of African juniper chronologies for accurate climate reconstruction and points out the relevance of building a network of juniper chronologies across East Africa.},

abstract = {A better understanding of the reasons for variation in tropical rain forest (TRF) structure is important for quantifying global above-ground biomass (AGBM). We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems ≥10cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown's (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the ‘OTS plots'), another was based on 1170 0.01ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the ‘Vegetation map plots'), and the third was from 18 0.5ha plots (the ‘Carbono plots') sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: flat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; flat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on flat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana life forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35–0.5ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of {\textless}12{\%} for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996). Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of stems, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of photosynthetic metabolism to temperature has been identified as a key uncertainty for projecting the magnitude of the terrestrial feedback on future climate change. While temperature responses of photosynthetic capacities have been comparatively well investigated in temperate species, the responses of tropical tree species remain unexplored. ? We compared the responses of seedlings of native cold-adapted tropical montane rainforest tree species with those of exotic warm-adapted plantation species, all growing in an interme- diate temperature common garden in Rwanda. Leaf gas exchange responses to carbon diox- ide (CO2) at different temperatures (20–40°C) were used to assess the temperature responses of biochemical photosynthetic capacities. ? Analyses revealed a lower optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport rates than for Rubisco carboxylation rates, along with lower electron transport optima in the native cold-adapted than in the exotic warm-adapted species. The photosynthetic optimum temper- atures were generally exceeded by daytime peak leaf temperatures, in particular in the native montane rainforest climax species. ? This study thus provides evidence of pronounced negative effects of high temperature in tropical trees and indicates high susceptibility of montane rainforest climax species to future global warming.},

abstract = {Managing tropical rain forests is difficult because few long-term field data on forest growth and the impact of harvesting disturbance are available. Growth models may provide a valuable tool for managers of tropical forests, particularly if applied to the extended forest areas of up to 100,000 ha that typically constitute the so-called forest management units (FMUs). We used a stand growth model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to simulate tropical rain forest growth at the FMU level. We applied the process-based rain forest growth model Formix 3-Q to the 55,000 ha Deramakot Forest Reserve (DFR) in Sabah, Malaysia. The FMU was considered to be composed of single and independent small-scale stands differing in site conditions and forest structure. Field data, which were analyzed with a GIS, comprised a terrestrial forest inventory, site and soil analyses (water, nutrients, slope), the interpretation of aerial photographs of the present vegetation and topographic maps. Different stand types were determined based on a classification of site quality (three classes), slopes (four classes), and present forest structure (four strata). The effects of site quality on tree allometry (height-diameter curve, biomass allometry, leaf area) and growth (increment size) are incorporated into Formix 3-Q. We derived allometric relations and growth factors for different site conditions from the field data. Climax forest structure at the stand level was shown to depend strongly on site conditions. Simulated successional pattern and climax structure were compared with field observations. Based on the current management plan for the DFR, harvesting scenarios were simulated for stands on different sites. The effects of harvesting guidelines on forest structure and the implications for sustainable forest management at Deramakot were analyzed. Based on the stand types and GIS analysis, we also simulated undisturbed regeneration of the logged-over forest in the DFR at the FMU level. The simulations predict slow recovery rates, and regeneration times far exceeding 100 years.},

@book{Werger2011,
abstract = {Preface Suriname is one of the most forested tropical countries. So far, deforestation has not been severe, probably because of the relatively small population, lack or inadequacy of a road infrastructure in the hinterlands, and low pressure for converting the forest into agricultural land. Moreover, harvestable commercial volumes in its forests are rather low as compared to some other tropical forest areas. Nevertheless, the timber value of these forests has long been recognized, and after the Second World War it was decided to develop a logging industry in the so-called Forest Belt, a 50 – 200 kilometers wide, accessible zone of lowland rainforests across the northern part of the country. The Suriname Forest Service (‘s Lands Bosbeheer, LBB) developed and for some time stood as a model forestry institution in the region. It aimed at the application of evidence-based. In v subsequent years Gerold Zondervan, then at CELOS, later at WWF Guianas, played a very significant role in preserving the experimental plots at Mapane and Kabo, emphasized their importance for forestry research, and encouraged re-starting the investigations. The results of these research projects in the tropical forest of Suriname have been reported in four Ph.D.-dissertations (issued in the series Ecology and Management of the Tropical Rain Forest in Suriname), many M.Sc.-theses, a number of publications in professional journals and books, and many internal reports (see Annex 1). But they have never been integrated in a comprehensive publication, evaluating the results so far obtained. In recent decades the interest in and importance of reduced impact logging and sustainable forest management strongly increased, and the interest in the CMS also grew, in Suriname and in other Latin American countries. As the documentation on this system was so widely scattered, it has proved difficult to readily gather an adequate account of the usefulness of the system. There was a clear need for a synthesis, bringing together a description of the CMS principles, its underlying yield model, its associated silvicultural treatments, as well as a balanced assessment of its long-term effects on the silvicultural and ecological dynamics and biological value of the managed forests, as apparent from the various studies carried out in the experimental stands. Such a synthesis would show the potential of the CMS to serve as a proper guide for forestry management in the region and beyond. At long last, the decision to produce such an integrated account was taken at the occasion of the farewell meeting for Reitze de Graaf, in 2005, when he retired from Wageningen University. The result is this book. It was initiated by Frits (G.M.J.) Mohren, and enthusiastically supported by CELOS (Rick O. van Ravenswaay, Rudi F. van Kanten), Tropenbos International Suriname and WWF Guianas. They encouraged the authors, including the core researchers who had worked in project LH/UvS 01 during 1977 to 1983 that directly led to the CELOS Management System, to embark on writing the chapters. They accessed relevant information and documentation from the CELOS archives and elsewhere, and recent information that had become available from re-measurements of the CELOS plots. It was decided to not just restrict the book to the CMS-related work in Suriname, but to also briefly assess the experiences with other forestry systems aimed at reduced impact logging or sustainable forest management in the tropics. This book, with contributions from 25 authors, tells in brief the history of forestry in Suriname and some other tropical countries. It reveals how the work on forestry in Suriname led to the development of a potentially sustainable forest management system, integrating a harvesting and a silvicultural system. And it documents the long-term effects of applying this system as apparent from a great deal of research in experimental forest stands of CELOS in Suriname. This information holds the evidence to determine the potential of the CELOS Management System to serve as a model for other systems of sustainable management of tropical forests in Suriname and beyond, particularly in other Latin American countries in the region with similar forests. This book makes the theoretical basis of the system, and the practical results as apparent from extensive and long-term experimental work in forest plots, readily available for a large readership, for those working in tropical forestry and forestry policy, as well as vi for those with just a general interest in tropical forests. This ecological, silvicultural and practical knowledge allows evaluation of the CMS in terms of present concepts and policies on tropical forests and tropical forestry, including the important developments in these fields since the Conference of Rio de Janeiro (1992), the introduction of forest certification standards and the developments around REDD(+). Is the CMS suitable as a source of inspiration, and a model that can be adapted for further development into a full-scale, practical and feasible silvicultural management system for tropical forests? silvicultural systems for the management of the permanent forest estate and at raising its production of useful timber. To achieve this, the Suriname Forest Service closely cooperated with forestry experts. Joop Schulz, Jan Boerboom and Reitze de Graaf played pioneering roles in developing forest management systems in which natural regeneration of commercial timber trees was an important feature, and forestry experiments were set up and monitored. After the independence of Suriname, in 1975, the involvement of Wageningen forestry experts in Surinamese forestry initially stayed firm, and in 1978 a new cooperation agreement was signed between the Anton de Kom University of Suriname and Wageningen University (then Wageningen Agricultural University – Landbouwhogeschool Wageningen) to further develop a forest management system for the sustainable production of timber (Project LH/UvS 01 also registered as MAB project 949). New experiments were set up at the field stations of the Centre for Agricultural Research in Suriname (CELOS) at Mapane and Kabo in the district of Para. LBB (Kenneth Tjon and Jaap de Vletter) initiated some experiments in the Mapane area too. Reitze de Graaf advocated the development of a polycyclic silvicultural system in Suriname, as against the earlier experiments with monocyclic approaches. Soon Reitze de Graaf, Wyb Jonkers and John Hendrison developed the theory, designed the experiments and collected the necessary experimental data on the basis of which the CELOS Silvicultural System (CSS) and the CELOS Harvesting System (CHS) were formulated and integrated into the CELOS Management System (CMS) for sustained forest exploitation and timber production. They formed a team with Onno Boxman, Jan Consen, Rein Poels (†2007), John Procter (†1979), Pieter Schmidt, Renate Tjon Lim Sang and Frank Vreden at CELOS, and this core of CMS-researchers attracted, stimulated and supervised other researchers, including many Surinamese and Dutch students in their practical training phase, to study various aspects of the natural and treated forests in the experimental plots at Mapane and Kabo and elsewhere in Suriname. Many inventories, measurements, monitoring censuses and a great deal of supplementary research were done, and a wealth of important data was gathered. In 1983 political developments caused the interruption of these research activities for a considerable number of years.},

At these low population densities, successful cross-pollination relies on synchronous flowering. In rainforests with low climatic seasonality, photoperiodic control is the only reliable mechanism for inducing synchronous flowering. This poses a problem because there is no variation in day length at the Equator. Here we propose a new mechanism of photoperiodic timekeeping based on the perception of variation in sunrise or sunset time, which explains and predicts the annually repeated, staggered, synchronous and bimodal flowering of many tree species in Amazonian rainforests near the Equator.},

abstract = {Shallow landslides are an important type of natural ecosystem disturbance in tropical montane forests. Due to landslides, vegetation and often also the upper soil layer are removed, and space for primary succession under altered environmental conditions is created. Little is known about how these altered conditions affect important aspects of forest recovery such as the establishment of new tree biomass and species composition. To address these questions we utilize a process-based forest simulation model and develop potential forest regrowth scenarios. We investigate how changes in different trees species characteristics influence forest recovery on landslide sites. The applied regrowth scenarios are: undisturbed regrowth (all tree species characteristics remain like in the undisturbed forest), reduced tree growth (induced by nutrient limitation), reduced tree establishment (due to thicket-forming vegetation and dispersal limitation) and increased tree mortality (due to post-landslide erosion and increased susceptibility). We then apply these scenarios to an evergreen tropical montane forest in southern Ecuador where landslides constitute a major source of natural disturbance. Our most important findings are. (a)On the local scale of a single landslide tree biomass recovers within the first 80 years after landslides for most scenarios, but it takes at least 200 years for the post-landslide forest to reach a structure (in terms of stem size distribution) similar to a mature forest. On this scale forest productivity is reduced for most regrowth scenarios. Changes in different tree species characteristics produce distinct spatio-temporal patterns of tree biomass distribution in the first decades of recovery within the landslide disturbed area. These patterns can potentially be used for identifying the dominant processes that drive forest recovery on landslide disturbed sites.(b)On the larger scale of the landscape overall tree biomass is reduced by 9-15{\%} due to landslide disturbances. Overall forest productivity is only slightly reduced ({\textless}6{\%}), but landslides increase landscape heterogeneity and produce hotspots of biomass loss and 'blind spots' of forest productivity. Thus landslides have a strong impact on the distribution of biomass in tropical montane forests. This study demonstrates that dynamic forest models are useful tools for complementing field based studies on landslides; they allow for testing alternative hypotheses on different sources of heterogeneity across spatial scales and investigating the influence of landslides on long-term forest dynamics. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Tropical rainforests are a major compartment of global biochemical cycles. Today these biomes are threatened by climate change and deforestation. Estimating the response of the productivity of these biomes to climate variability is a great challenge. This study investigate the potential of a forest gap model to assess carbon fluxes of a trop- ical rainforest located in French Guyana at yearly and daily time scale under variable climate. Forest model simulations were linked with eddy covariance measurements of gross primary production (GPP), respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) in order to analyze individual model processes that describe the limitation of productivity and respiration due to temperature and water stress. Four parameterizations were de- veloped and compared with each other regarding their potential to reproduce observed carbon fluxes. One parameterization based mainly on literature, the other three param- eterizations resulting from different numerical calibration processes. The study shows that, in general, the forest model is capable to simulate the observed carbon fluxes under variable climate. Deviations between observed and simulated data could be ob- served on days with extreme climate conditions. Furthermore, the influence of climate change on the tropical forest in French Guyana is analyzed using two climate change scenarios as predicted by the IPCC. In order to understand the impact of the climate change on the forest in French Guyana, seasonal variations in daily carbon fluxes were analyzed. The simulation has shown that increasing CO2 and temperature leading to an likewise increase in productivity and respiration. NEP remains positive during the climate change scenario. After a recovery time the model outcome shows a biomass increase of early and mid successional trees. This could be a sign for a resilience of the forest in French Guyana under climate change due to a shift in PFT dominate toward early successional trees.},

abstract = {Radial growth and xylogenesis were studied to investigate the influence of climate variability and intraspecific competition on secondary growth in Abies pinsapo Boiss., a relic Mediterranean fir. We monitored the responses to three thinning treatments (unthinned control -C-, 30{\%} -T30- and 60{\%} -T60- of basal area removed) to test the hypothesis that they may improve the adaptation capacity of tree growth to climatic stress. We also assessed whether xylogenesis was differentially affected by tree-to-tree competition. Secondary growth was assessed using manual band dendrometers from 2005 to 2007. In 2006, xylogenesis (phases of tracheid formation) was also investigated by taking microcores and performing histological analyses. Seasonal dynamics of radial increment were modeled using Gompertz functions and correlations with microclimate and radiation were performed. Histological analyses revealed it as fundamental to calibrate the dendrometer estimates of radial increment and to establish the actual onset and end dates of tracheid production. The lower radial-increment rates and number of produced tracheids were observed in the trees subjected to high competition in the unthinned plots. The growing season differed among the plots, and its duration ranged from an average of 78 days in unthinned plots to 115 days in thinned ones (T60). Variations in the beginning of the growing season (13 April to 22 May) and earlywood-latewood transition (early August) were mainly determined by the temperature pattern, while the onset and the end of the growing season were related to both annual precipitation and tree-to-tree competition. The tracheid-formation phases of radial enlargement and cell-wall thickening showed similar patterns in the trees from thinned and unthinned plots subjected to low and high competition, respectively, but the mean number of tracheids in each phase was always higher in the trees from the thinned plots. The reduction of competition through thinning induced a longer growing season and enhanced the radial growth in A. pinsapo.},

abstract = {The dynamics of the forest at the ecotone of the boreal forest and temperate forest in Northeast China were simulated using the adapted gap model BKPF under global climatic change (GFDL scenario) and doubled CO2 concentrations at 50 years in the future. The response of tree species and species with similar biological characteristics under global climate change and double CO2 concentrations were based on biophysical limits of the tree species in the area and their biolog- ical competition. The results showed that after 50 years the stand density and LAI (leaf area index) of the forest growing from a clear-cut would not be significantly different from those under current conditions. Stand productivity would increase about 7{\%}, and stand aboveground biomass would increase 15{\%}. However, the stand density of the current mature forest would be reduced by more than 20{\%}.

abstract = {A comparison is made between the timber certification system of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) of Germany and the PEFC (Pan-European Forest Certification) of Austria. The comparison of timber certification systems by FSC and PEFC for Austria depends on the state of knowledge that includes at this time regular certifications in domestic operations/regions. For lack of domestic FSC implementation determinations the analysis was made with the German FSC determinations. A difference is the sought for global validity according to FSC in contrast to the European approach of the family forest economy according to the PEFC. Regional certification regularly better accommodates this small area structure. PEFC requires at least 70{\%} certified timber for the trade and processing chain "chain of custody" whereas FSC requires only 30{\%} certified timber. There are above all differences in the formulation of goals. PEFC sets in advance a percentage and species limitation and requires special types and living space for the supply of the hemerobie (variety of types). The {\"{O}}GNU (Austrian Environmental Umbrella Organization) expects a small sales potential for FSC certification above all from large operations and industries. The participation possibilities are clearly regulated according to the German model. In Austria, according to the PEFC, there is the principle of unanimity with a right to veto for the {\"{O}}GNU. The acceptance of the PEFC by timber processors is still awaited. PEFC proponents stress the mutual recognition to avoid the loss of image for timber. Both systems are not accepted unconditionally by environmental organizations. Certification organizations are accredited by the FSC itself but as a rule, with respect to the PEFC, they are accredited by the state. Table.},

We assessed the effects of logging on total and merchantable bole (i.e., lowest branch at crown base) heights on 952 tropical canopy trees in French Guiana. We observed reductions in both total (mean, −2.3 m) and bole (mean, −2.0 m) heights more than a decade after selective logging. Depending on local logging intensity, height reductions resulted in 2–13 percent decreases in aboveground tree biomass and 3–17 percent decreases in bole volume. These results highlight the adverse effects of logging at both tree and stand levels. This decrease in height is a further threat to future provision of key environmental services, such as timber production and carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Tropical canopy dominance in lowland, well-drained forests by one plant species is a long-standing conundrum in tropical biology. Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed-species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small-seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.},

abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

The trees' annual diameter increments in this 16-yr period were negatively correlated with annual means of daily minimum temperatures. The tree growth variations also negatively covaried with the net carbon exchange of the terrestrial tropics as a whole, as inferred from nearly pole-to-pole measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) interpreted by an inverse tracer–transport model. Strong reductions in tree growth and large inferred tropical releases of CO2 to the atmosphere occurred during the record-hot 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o. These and other recent findings are consistent with decreased net primary production in tropical forests in the warmer years of the last two decades. As has been projected by recent process model studies, such a sensitivity of tropical forest productivity to on-going climate change would accelerate the rate of atmospheric CO2 accumulation.},

To look at these climate impacts, we used a coupled model of tropical tree growth and mortality, calibrated with forest dynamic data from the 20-year study site of Paracou, French Guiana, in order to introduce and test a set of climatic variables. Three major climatic drivers were identified through the variable selection procedure: drought, water saturation and temperature. Drought decreased annual growth and mortality rates, high precipitation increased mortality rates and high temperature decreased growth. Interactions between key functional traits, stature and climatic variables were investigated, showing best resistance to drought for trees with high wood density and for trees with small current diameters. Our results highlighted strong long-term impacts of climate variables on tropical forest dynamics, suggesting potential deep impacts of climate changes during the next century.},

abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90{\%} of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

abstract = {A number of operationally defined methods exist for pretreating plant tissues in order to measure C, N, and O isotopes. Because these isotope measurements are used to infer information about environmental conditions that existed at the time of tissue growth, it is important that these pretreatments remove compounds that may have exchanged isotopes or have been synthesized after the original formation of these tissues. In stable isotope studies, many pretreatment methods focus on isolating "cellulose" from the bulk tissue sample because cellulose does not exchange C and O isotopes after original synthesis. We investigated the efficacy of three commonly applied pretreatment methods, the Brendel method and two variants of the Brendel method, the Jayme-Wise method and successive acid/base/acid washes, for use on three tissue types (wood, leaves, roots). We then compared the effect of each method on C and O isotope composition (13C, 14C, 18O), C and N content, and chemical composition of the residue produced (using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)). Our results raised concerns over use of the Brendel method as published, as it both added C and N to the sample and left a residue that contains remnant lipids and waxes. Furthermore, this method resulted in 18O values that are enriched relative to the other methods. Modifying the Brendel method by adding a NaOH step (wash) solved many of these problems. We also found that processed residues vary by tissue type. For wood and root tissues, the 13C NMR spectra and the 18O and 13C data showed only small differences between residues for the Jayme-Wise and modified Brendel methods. However, for leaf tissue, 13C NMR data showed that Jayme-Wise pretreatments produced residues that are more chemically similar to cellulose than the other methods. The acid/base/acid washing method generated 13C NMR spectra with incomplete removal of lignin for all tissues tested and both isotopic, and 13C NMR results confirmed that this method should not be used if purified cellulose is desired.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). 5. Functional traits explained 19-42{\%} of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

abstract = {Managing tropical rain forests is difficult because few long-term field data on forest growth and the impact of harvesting disturbance are available. Growth models may provide a valuable tool for managers of tropical forests, particularly if applied to the extended forest areas of up to 100,000 ha that typically constitute the so-called forest management units (FMUs). We used a stand growth model in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to simulate tropical rain forest growth at the FMU level. We applied the process-based rain forest growth model Formix 3-Q to the 55,000 ha Deramakot Forest Reserve (DFR) in Sabah, Malaysia. The FMU was considered to be composed of single and independent small-scale stands differing in site conditions and forest structure. Field data, which were analyzed with a GIS, comprised a terrestrial forest inventory, site and soil analyses (water, nutrients, slope), the interpretation of aerial photographs of the present vegetation and topographic maps. Different stand types were determined based on a classification of site quality (three classes), slopes (four classes), and present forest structure (four strata). The effects of site quality on tree allometry (height-diameter curve, biomass allometry, leaf area) and growth (increment size) are incorporated into Formix 3-Q. We derived allometric relations and growth factors for different site conditions from the field data. Climax forest structure at the stand level was shown to depend strongly on site conditions. Simulated successional pattern and climax structure were compared with field observations. Based on the current management plan for the DFR, harvesting scenarios were simulated for stands on different sites. The effects of harvesting guidelines on forest structure and the implications for sustainable forest management at Deramakot were analyzed. Based on the stand types and GIS analysis, we also simulated undisturbed regeneration of the logged-over forest in the DFR at the FMU level. The simulations predict slow recovery rates, and regeneration times far exceeding 100 years.},

@article{Huntingford2008,
abstract = {Simulations with the Hadley Centre general circulation model (HadCM3), including carbon cycle model and forced by a 'business-as-usual' emissions scenario, predict a rapid loss of Amazonian rainforest from the middle of this century onwards. The robustness of this projection to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer canopy light interception model and compare with the simple 'big-leaf' approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography). We find that the loss of Amazonian rainforest is robust across the climate uncertainty explored by perturbed physics simulations covering a wide range of global climate sensitivity. The introduction of the refined light interception model leads to an increase in simulated gross plant carbon uptake for the present day, but, with altered respiration, the net effect is a decrease in net primary productivity. However, this does not significantly affect the carbon loss from vegetation and soil as a consequence of future simulated depletion in soil moisture; the Amazon forest is still lost. The introduction of the more sophisticated dynamic vegetation model reduces but does not halt the rate of forest dieback. The potential for human-induced climate change to trigger the loss of Amazon rainforest appears robust within the context of the uncertainties explored in this paper. Some further uncertainties should be explored, particularly with respect to the representation of rooting depth.},

abstract = {Question: What are the relative roles of tree growth, mortality and recruitment in variations of above- ground biomass in tropical forests? Location: Paracou, French Guiana. Methods: We quantified the contribution of growth, recruitment and mortality to total biomass of stands (trees DBH ? 10 cm) in six 6.25-ha permanent plots over 16 yr. Live biomass stocks and fluxes were computed for four separate size classes. Results: All plots showed increasing biomass stocks over the study period, with an average value of 10.9Mgha?1 yr?1. Plots aggrading biomass were characterized by either minor biomass losses due to mortality or substantial increases in the biomass of large trees (DBH ? 60 cm). Conclusions: Within the study period, the rarity of mortality events could not counter-balance the slow permanent increase in biomass, resulting in an appar- ent increase in biomass. Accounting for such rare events results in no net change in biomass balance.},

abstract = {The recent development of REDD+ mechanisms requires reliable estimation of carbon stocks, especially in tropical forests that are particularly threatened by global changes. Even though tree height is a crucial variable for computing aboveground forest biomass (AGB), it is rarely measured in large-scale forest censuses because it requires extra effort. Therefore, tree height has to be predicted with height models. The height and diameter of all trees over 10 cm in diameter were measured in 33 half-hectare plots and 9 one-hectare plots throughout northern French Guiana, an area with substantial climate and environmental gradients. We compared four different model shapes and found that the Michaelis–Menten shape was most appropriate for the tree biomass prediction. Model parameter values were significantly different from one forest plot to another, and this leads to large errors in biomass estimates. Variables from the forest stand structure explained a sufficient part of plot-to-plot variations of the height model parameters to improve the quality of the AGB predictions. In the forest stands dominated by small trees, the trees were found to have rapid height growth for small diameters. In forest stands dominated by larger trees, the trees were found to have the greatest heights for large diameters. The aboveground biomass estimation uncertainty of the forest plots was reduced by the use of the forest structure-based height model. It demonstrated the feasibility and the importance of height modeling in tropical forests for carbon mapping. When the tree heights are not measured in an inventory, they can be predicted with a height–diameter model and incorporating forest structure descriptors may improve the predictions.},

abstract = {Tropical forests will experience relatively large changes in temperature and rainfall towards the end of this century. Little is known about how tropical trees will respond to these changes. We used tree rings to establish climate-growth relations of a pioneer tree, Mimosa acantholoba, occurring in tropical dry secondary forests in southern Mexico. The role of large-scale climatic drivers in determining interannual growth variation was studied by correlating growth to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Annual growth varied eightfold over 1970-2007, and was correlated with wet season rainfall (r=0.75). Temperature, cloud cover and solar variation did not affect growth, although these climate variables correlated with growth due to their relations with rainfall. Strong positive correlations between growth and SSTA occurred in the North tropical Atlantic during the first half of the year, and in the Pacific during the second half of the year. The Pacific influence corresponded closely to ENSO-like influences with negative effects of high SSTA in the eastern Pacific Nino3.4 region on growth due to decreases in rainfall. During El Nino years growth was reduced by 37{\%}. We estimated how growth would be affected by the predicted trend of decreasing rainfall in Central America towards the end of this century. Using rainfall predictions of two sets of climate models, we estimated that growth at the end of this century will be reduced by 12{\%} under a medium (A1B) and 21{\%} under a high (A2) emission scenario. These results suggest that climate change may have repercussions for the carbon sequestration capacity of tropical dry forests in the region.},

There is significant compositional variability both within and between trees, but no systematic dendrochemical correlation with periods of effusive, explosive or increased degassing activity. Dendrochemistry does not provide a record of persistent but fluctuating volcanic activity. Foliar levels of bioaccumulated cations correspond to modelled plume transport patterns, and map short-term volcanic fumigation. Around the flanks of the volcano foliar variation is greater for volatile cations (Cs, Cd, Pb) than for lithophilic cations (Ba, Sr), consistent with trace-metal supply from volcanic aerosol during quiescent periods. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Tropical forests are global centres of biodiversity and carbon storage. Many tropical countries aspire to protect forest to fulfil biodiversity and climate mitigation policy targets, but the conservation strategies needed to achieve these two functions depend critically on the tropical forest tree diversity-carbon storage relationship. Assessing this relationship is challenging due to the scarcity of inventories where carbon stocks in aboveground biomass and species identifications have been simultaneously and robustly quantified. Here, we compile a unique pan-tropical dataset of 360 plots located in structurally intact old-growth closed-canopy forest, surveyed using standardised methods, allowing a multi-scale evaluation of diversity-carbon relationships in tropical forests. Diversity-carbon relationships among all plots at 1 ha scale across the tropics are absent, and within continents are either weak (Asia) or absent (Amazonia, Africa). A weak positive relationship is detectable within 1 ha plots, indicating that diversity effects in tropical forests may be scale dependent. The absence of clear diversity-carbon relationships at scales relevant to conservation planning means that carbon-centred conservation strategies will inevitably miss many high diversity ecosystems. As tropical forests can have any combination of tree diversity and carbon stocks both require explicit consideration when optimising policies to manage tropical carbon and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Although several proxies have been proposed to trace the course of environmental and climatological fluctuations, precise paleoclimate records from the tropics, notably from Africa are still sorely lacking today. Stable carbon isotopes ($\delta$13C) in tree rings are an attractive record of climate. In this study, the patterns and climatic signals of $\delta$13C ratios were determined on tree rings of deciduous (Acacia senegal, Acacia tortilis, Acacia seyal) and an evergreen (Balanites aegyptiaca) species, from a semi-arid Acacia Woodland in Ethiopia. $\delta$13C inter-annual patterns are synchronous among the co-occurring species. A declining trend with time was observed in $\delta$13C, notably for B. aegyptiaca, which could be due to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration and decrease in atmospheric $\delta$13C. Tree ring $\delta$13C values of all the species revealed significant negative correlation with precipitation amount but not with temperature and relative humidity. The $\delta$13C series of the deciduous species shows a higher correlation (r = - 0.70 to - 0.78) with precipitation than the evergreen species (r = - 0.55). A master $\delta$13C series, composed of the average of the three Acacia species, displayed stronger significant correlation (r = - 0.82) than any of the individual species $\delta$13C series. The weak relationship between temperature and $\delta$13C in this study indicates that photosynthetic rate is not a significant factor. Moisture stress, however, may have a direct impact on the stomatal conductance and explain the strong negative relationship between $\delta$13C and precipitation. The results demonstrate the potential of $\delta$13C in tree rings to reflect physiological responses to environmental changes as a vehicle for paleoclimatic reconstruction, which is important to understand tree response to past and future climate change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The Forest Stewardship Council and others have proposed systems of 'ecological certification', where otherwise very similar products are viewed by consumers as different products because additional information on the products' history is provided. The 'certification' assures the consumer that the products have been produced with practices that meet fundamental ecological and social standards. For ecological certification systems to be viable and deliver products to the market over the long term, the relationships among key components must evolve economically and institutionally. Consisting of local forest management firms, local certifying non-government organizations, international non-government organizations, timber and product markets, the ecological certification system transcends local forests and communities to international markets. Conceptually, the system is a series of principal- agent relationships. This paper, in addition to developing the concept of ecological certification, analyzes the relationships among the many actors and the relationship of the actors to the forest.},

Assessment of various factors (legal, institutional, social-economic, natural, etc.) affecting the ecosystems is one of the efficient ways of overcoming these problems. It is the methodological base for planning and implementation of further activities. Particularly, the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) has together with World Bank and World Wide Fund for Nature developed a framework aimed at the development of the management effectiveness assessment system (Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool, METT): At present the regional program “Improving Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in the European Neighbourhood Policy East Countries and Russia – ENPI FLEG Program” is implemented in Armenia aimed at putting in place improved forest governance arrangements through effective implementation of the main priorities set out in the St. Petersburg Ministerial Declaration and Indicative Plan of Actions for the Europe and North Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (ENA-FLEG) process. Implementation of the Program is led by the World Bank, working in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and in close coordination with Government and non-governmental stakeholders of the participating countries. Action plan and timetable of activities were developed in the framework of the project. The activity “Assessment of Management Effectiveness and Law Enforcement in the Forest Sanctuaries in Armenia” was carried out by WWF Armenia during March- May, 2010. The assignment was aimed at the assessment of management and law enforcement effectiveness in two forest Sanctuaries in the structure of “Hayantar” SNCO.

abstract = {The dominant management strategy in boreal forests-aggregated clearcuts (AC)-faces increased criticism by various stakeholders, including Aboriginal people. Two alternative strategies have been proposed: dispersed clearcuts (DC) and ecosystem-based management (EM). We modelled the long-term and landscape-scale effects of AC, DC, and EM on a set of indicators of sustainable forest management relevant to an Aboriginal community's values: (1) forest age structure; (2) spatial configuration of forest stands; (3) road network density; and, (4) forest habitat loss to clearcuts. EM created a forest age structure closer to what would result from a natural disturbance regime, compared to AC and DC. Cut blocks were more evenly distributed with EM and DC. The road network density was lower and increased slower with EM, thus reducing the potential for conflicts between forest users. Under EM, a higher forest cover was maintained (and thus potential wildlife habitat) than in AC or DC. The EM scenario provided the best outcome based on the four measured indicators, partly because the constraints imposed on the modeling exercise led it to harvest less than the other scenarios. Annual allowable cut should thus be a key factor to consider to ensuring better compliance with Aboriginal criteria of sustainable forest management.},

Enrichment planting of selected native tree species into forest gaps$\backslash$nis a strategy that may increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity. However, the development of successful planting$\backslash$nstrategies requires knowledge of environmental demands on, and ecological requirements of, native species during their establishment.$\backslash$nThis knowledge is currently lacking for mid- and late-successional species in Central American forests. Two deciduous, mid-successional$\backslash$n(Cedrela montana, Tabebuia chrysantha) and two evergreen, late-successional native tree species (Nectandra membranacea, Podocarpus sprucei) were planted into felling gaps. Photosynthetic performance and growth in height of these species were assessed along light$\backslash$ngradients during seedling establishment to test whether species-specific light responses were related to plant successional$\backslash$ntraits. Both mid-successional species benefited from higher light levels in gaps up to 30{\%} canopy openness60°. In larger gaps, C. montana exhibited a significant decline in growth. As expected, growth of the late-successional species was only marginally increased$\backslash$nat higher light levels. Nevertheless, the photosynthetic apparatus of N. membranacea displayed rapid acclimation to higher light conditions in gaps. Plant response to felling gaps may not always be predicted$\backslash$nbased on successional status. Our results suggest that the four investigated species may coexist in the same gap by occupying$\backslash$ndifferent niches along light gradients.

abstract = {This Synthesis Report is based on the reports of the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including relevant Special Reports. It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). This summary follows the structure of the longer report, which addresses the following topics: Observed changes and their causes; Future climate change, risks and impacts; Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development; Adaptation and mitigation. In the Synthesis Report, the certainty in key assessment findings is communicated as in the Working Group Reports and Special Reports. It is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain)1. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. This report includes information relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). SPM},

abstract = {Most tree species in tropical mountain rain forests are naturally associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Previous studies in southern Ecuador of 115 tree species revealed that only three species were not associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Seedlings of tropical tree species raised in the nursery may need to be associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to survive transplantation shock in higher numbers. Methods for establishing plantations with native tree species are not yet established for Ecuador. Thus, we investigated the feasibility of using mycorrhizal roots of seedlings of Inga acreana, Tabebuia chrysantha, Cedrela montana and Heliocarpus americanus that had trapped mycorrhizal fungi from forest humus in the nursery to inoculate C. montana and H. americanus with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Inoculation with either a mixture of mycorrhizal roots from the four species or only with mycorrhizal roots from the same tree species were compared with effects of moderate fertilization. Assessment of plant growth and mycorrhizal status of 6-months-old Cedrela montana and Heliocarpus americanus revealed an improvement in growth and diverse associated fungi through mycorrhizal root inoculation in comparison with moderate fertilization. Moderate fertilization did not suppress mycorrhization.},

abstract = {Tree demography was analysed by applying dendrochronological techniques and matrix modelling on a static data set of Juniperus procera populations of Ethiopian dry highland forests. Six permanent sample plots were established for an inventory of diameters and 11 stem discs were collected for dendrochronological analysis. J. procera was proved to form concentric annual growth layers in response to seasonal changes in precipitation. Uncertainty analysis for the matrix model revealed its robustness to variations in parameter estimates. The major outcome was that the population growth rate is very sensitive to changes in growth or survival of trees between 10 and 40 cm DBH. For forest management this implies that these intermediate sized individuals should be protected and less used for harvest. This study documents that interesting results can be achieved using a relatively simple approach that can easily be adopted for other areas or with other species. However, the matrix modelling requires more precise knowledge about the trees' fecundity and survival (especially for the smaller individuals) and more consistent inventories. For tree-ring analysis it can be concluded that J. procera from Ethiopia has potential to investigate the relationship between tree growth and precipitation with a high temporal resolution. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Responses to climate change must now focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid runaway impacts (avoiding the unmanageable) and on addressing the impacts that are already with us (managing the unavoidable). Managing natural ecosystems as carbon sinks and resources for adaptation is increasingly recognised as a necessary, efficient and relatively cost-effective strategy. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change recommended that governments develop policies for climate sensitive public goods including natural resource protection, coastal protection and emergency preparedness. The worlds protected area network already helps mitigate and adapt to climate change. Protected areas store 15 per cent of terrestrial carbon and supply ecosystem services for disaster reduction, water supply, food and public health, all of which enable community-based adaptation. Many natural and managed ecosystems can help reduce climate change impacts. But protected areas have advantages over other approaches to natural ecosystem management in terms of legal and governance clarity, capacity and effectiveness. In many cases protection is the only way of keeping carbon locked in and ecosystem services running smoothly. Without the investment made in protected areas systems worldwide, the situation would be even worse. Increasing investment through a partnership of governments, communities, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organisations and the private sector would ensure greater protection of these essential services. Evidence suggests that protected areas work: even since this report was completed, a new World Bank review shows how tropical protected areas, especially those conserved by indigenous peoples, lose less forest than other management systems. But these co-benefits for climate, biodiversity and society are often missed or ignored. This book clearly articulates for the first time how protected areas contribute significantly to reducing impacts of climate change and what is needed for them to achieve even more. As we enter an unprecedented scale of negotiations about climate and biodiversity it is important that these messages reach policy makers loud and clear and are translated into effective policies and funding mechanisms.},

The test of the annual ring formation was performed using radiocarbon analysis based on the nuclear weapon effect. All species showed growth rings visible to the naked eye. The ring boundaries in all cases were marked by bands of marginal parenchyma. The index ring- width curves of the four studied species showed a strong relationship with the fluctuation of the water river level during the non flooded months, suggesting that an increase in the water level during these months positively influenced the growth indicating that the rings were formed on an annual basis. The content of radiocarbon in the wood of anatomically predated rings of Campsiandra laurifolia and Pouteria orinocoensis confirm these results.

abstract = {Use of reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques has repeatedly been shown to reduce damage caused by logging. Unfortunately, these techniques do not necessarily ameliorate the low growth rates of many commercial species or otherwise assure recovery of the initial volume harvested during the next cutting cycle. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates on trees in general and on of future crop trees (FCTs) of 24 commercial timber species. The study was carried out in a moist tropical forest in Bolivia, where we monitored twelve 27-ha plots for 4 years. Plots received one of four treatments in which logging intensity and silvicultural treatments were varied: control (no logging); normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; and, increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture. Tree growth rates increased with intensity of logging and silvicultural treatments. The growth rates of FCTs of commercial species were 50-60{\%} higher in plots that received silvicultural treatments than in the normal logging and control plots. Responses to silvicultural treatments varied among functional groups. The largest increase in growth rates was observed in FCTs belonging to the partially shade-tolerant and the shade-tolerant groups. These results indicate that silvicultural treatments, in addition to the use of RIL techniques, are more likely to result in a higher percentage of timber volume being recovered after the first cutting cycle than RIL alone. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Despite considerable interest in the application of plant functional traits to questions of community assembly and ecosystem structure and function, there is no consensus on the appropriateness of sampling designs to obtain plot-level estimates in diverse plant communities. 2. We measured 10 plant functional traits describing leaf and stem morphology and ecophysiology for all trees in nine 1-ha plots in terra firme lowland tropical rain forests of French Guiana (N = 4709). 3.We calculated, by simulation, the mean and variance in trait values for each plot and each trait expected under seven sampling methods and a range of sampling intensities. Simulated sampling methods included a variety of spatial designs, as well as the application of existing data base values to all individuals of a given species. 4. For each trait in each plot, we defined a performance index for each sampling design as the proportion of resampling events that resulted in observed means within 5{\%} of the true plot mean, and observed variance within 20{\%}of the true plot variance. 5. The relative performance of sampling designs was consistent for estimations of means and variances. Data base use had consistently poor performance for most traits across all plots, whereas sampling one individual per species per plot resulted in relatively high performance. We found few differences among different spatial sampling strategies; however, for a given strategy, increased intensity of sampling resulted in markedly improved accuracy in estimates of trait mean and variance. 6. We also calculated the financial cost of each sampling design based on data from our ‘every individual per plot' strategy and estimated the sampling and botanical effort required. The relative performance of designs was strongly positively correlated with relative financial cost, suggesting that sampling investment returns are relatively constant. 7. Our results suggest that trait sampling for many objectives in species-rich plant communities may require the considerable effort of sampling at least one individual of each species in each plot, and that investment in complete sampling, though great, may be worthwhile for at least some traits.},

This original network is centred on the French Alps influenced by the Atlantic, Continental, and Mediterranean synoptic systems. Results A spatial clustering pattern matching the latitudinal climatic gradient was observed in tree ring indexed chronologies and climate responses. The stationary response functions computed for each cluster-averaged population evidenced a thermo-dependent northern cluster (Cl1), a rainfall-dependent southern cluster (Cl3), and an alternative response for the intermediate cluster in between (Cl2). Since the late nineteenth century, the moving response functions indicate an increasing influence of winter precipitation for the northern and the intermediate clusters. Conclusion Considering the increase in temperature and reduction both of summer precipitation predicted by general circulation models and of the snow cover and duration in the French Alps, stone pine is likely to be exposed to stressful conditions during the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term ({\textgreater}50. yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives.As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability and productivity. However, dynamic global vegeta- tion models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait data- base, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (Narea), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea ), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade- offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diver- sity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait diver- gence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species- rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem man- agement from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.},

abstract = {Establishing a direct link between climate change and fluctuations in animal populations through long-term monitoring is difficult given the paucity of baseline data. We hypothesized that social wasps are sensitive to climatic variations, and thus studied the impact of ENSO events on social wasp populations in French Guiana. We noted that during the 2000 La Ni{\~{n}}a year there was a 77.1{\%} decrease in their nest abundance along ca. 5 km of forest edges, and that 70.5{\%} of the species were no longer present. Two simultaneous 13-year surveys (1997-2009) confirmed the decrease in social wasps during La Ni{\~{n}}a years (2000 and 2006), while an increase occurred during the 2009 El Ni{\~{n}}o year. A 30-year weather survey showed that these phenomena corresponded to particularly high levels of rainfall, and that temperature, humidity and global solar radiation were correlated with rainfall. Using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm, we show that heavy rainfall during an entire rainy season has a negative impact on social wasps. Strong contrasts in rainfall between the dry season and the short rainy season exacerbate this effect. Social wasp populations never recovered to their pre-2000 levels. This is probably because these conditions occurred over four years; heavy rainfall during the major rainy seasons during four other years also had a detrimental effect. On the contrary, low levels of rainfall during the major rainy season in 2009 spurred an increase in social wasp populations. We conclude that recent climatic changes have likely resulted in fewer social wasp colonies because they have lowered the wasps' resistance to parasitoids and pathogens. These results imply that Neotropical social wasps can be regarded as bio-indicators because they highlight the impact of climatic changes not yet perceptible in plants and other animals.},

abstract = {Tropical canopy dominance in lowland, well-drained forests by one plant species is a long-standing conundrum in tropical biology. Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed-species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small-seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests are ecologically relevant reservoirs of biodiversity and provide valuable and unique ecosystem functions in the landscape. However, what constitutes an old-growth stand is confusing because the definition depends largely on the forest type under study. Despite the ecological importance of old-growth temperate rainforests in southern Chile in comparison to other global forests, no attempts have been made to characterize them as a way to assess their structural variability. Here, we characterized old-growth stands of Valdivian and North Patagonian rain forest types located in Chilo{\'{e}} Island (Chile, 42°30′S) using inventory data from 23 permanent plots (0.1 ha each) located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern Chilo{\'{e}} Island. For each stand, its age (average age of the oldest trees present in each stand) and disturbance regimes (evidence of recent human impact, e.g. cuttings or fires, and tree growth rates) were used as defining old-growth criteria. We characterized the structure (tree species richness, size-density distributions, vertical stratification and presence of snags) and floristic composition of each stand. Environmental variables (i.e. temperature, distance to coastline and elevation) were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis. Old-growth forests were commonly characterized by (a) tree basal areas {\textgreater}80 m2/ha; (b) density of shade-tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer {\textgreater}36{\%}; (c) higher tree species richness ({\textgreater}7 tree species) than successional stands; (d) presence of large canopy emergents ({\textgreater}80 cm dbh, {\textgreater}25 m tall); (e) high vertical heterogeneity; and (f) minimum stand ages older than 200 years. Old-growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands. Structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites (e.g. air temperature, distance to coastline, soil types). Old-growth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Niche differentiation and ecological filtering are primary ecological processes that shape community assembly, but their relative importance remains poorly understood. Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can provide insight into the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1-ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of niche differentiation and ecological filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed.},

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no explicit formulation of the exact L2 approximation error for the truncated inverse filters. The approach to determine the minimum inverse model-order subject to the maximum allowable L2 approximation error is also in demand. In this paper, we present two L2 approximation error measures and the two corresponding optimal finite-support approximates. Also, we derive the explicit L2 approximation error functions with respect to roots, multiplicities and model orders for these two kinds of approximates. Then, we propose a new algorithm to determine the minimum total model order of the appropriate truncated inverse filter to achieve a specified L2 approximation error. Our newly derived L2 approximation error evaluation method can be employed for signal processing, telecommunication, control systems involving the inverse filtering in the future. Besides, our novel model-order determination algorithm can be utilized for efficient dynamic memory allocation in a wide variety of applications since such a minimum total model order is proportional to the memory usage for any inverse filter implementation.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes in tree rings have widely been used for palaeoclimate reconstructions since tree rings record climatic information at annual resolution. However, various wood components or different parts of an annual tree-ring may differ in their isotopic compositions. Thus, sample preparation and subsequent laboratory analysis are crucial for the isotopic signal retained in the final tree-ring isotope series used for climate reconstruction and must therefore be considered for the interpretation of isotope-climate relationships. This study focuses on wood of Corsican Pine trees (Pinus nigra ssp. laricio) as this tree species allows to reconstruct the long-term climate evolution in the western Mediterranean. In a pilot study, we concentrated on methodological issues of sample preparation techniques in order to evaluate isotope records measured on pooled whole tree-ring cellulose and whole tree-ring bulk wood samples. We analysed 80-year long carbon and oxygen chronologies of Corsican Pine trees growing near the upper tree line on Corsica. Carbon and oxygen isotope records of whole tree-ring bulk wood and whole tree-ring cellulose from a pooled sample of 5 trees were correlated with the climate parameters monthly precipitation, temperature and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI). Results show that the offsets in carbon and oxygen isotopes of bulk wood and cellulose are not constant over time. Both isotopes correlate with climate parameters from late winter and summer. The carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of cellulose are more sensitive to climatic variables than those of bulk wood. The results of this study imply that extraction of cellulose is a pre-requisite for the reconstruction of high-resolution climate records from stable isotope series of P. nigra ssp. laricio. ?? 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity2–5 . So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change6 . Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth7 , we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

abstract = {Cedrela montana is a deciduous broad-leaved tree species growing in the humid mountain rainforests of southern Ecuador. High-resolution dendrometer data indicate a regular seasonal growth rhythm with cambial activity during January to April. Amplitudes of daily T radial stem diameter variations are correlated with the amount of the maximum daily vapour pressure deficit. During humid periods, daily stem diameter variations are considerably, smaller than during drier periods. This indicates that cambial activity is limited by available moisture even in such a very humid mountain climate. Wood anatomical Studies on microcores show the formation of a marginal parenchyma band at the beginning of the growth Period. This parenchyma band can be used to delineate annual growth rings. We were able to establish the first ring-width chronology from Cedrela montana which covers the. time until 1840. However, the chronology, is presently statistically robust back to 1910 only Correlation functions calculated with NCEP/NCAR data indicate a significantly positive relationship of tree growth with temperatures during the growth period during January to April. However, only 8{\%} of the growth variance is explained by this climatic factor. In the future, this relationship may be useful to reconstruct past temperature conditions of the study area},

abstract = {Differential species responses to atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) could lead to quantitative changes in competition among species and community composition, with flow-on effects for ecosystem function. However, there has been little theoretical analysis of how elevated C-a (eC(a)) will affect plant competition, or how composition of plant communities might change. Such theoretical analysis is needed for developing testable hypotheses to frame experimental research. Here, we investigated theoretically how plant competition might change under eC(a) by implementing two alternative competition theories, resource use theory and resource capture theory, in a plant carbon and nitrogen cycling model. The model makes several novel predictions for the impact of eC(a) on plant community composition. Using resource use theory, the model predicts that eC(a) is unlikely to change species dominance in competition, but is likely to increase coexistence among species. Using resource capture theory, the model predicts that eC(a) may increase community evenness. Collectively, both theories suggest that eC(a) will favor coexistence and hence that species diversity should increase with eC(a). Our theoretical analysis leads to a novel hypothesis for the impact of eC(a) on plant community composition. This hypothesis has potential to help guide the design and interpretation of eC(a) experiments.},

abstract = {Responses to climate change must now focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid runaway impacts (avoiding the unmanageable) and on addressing the impacts that are already with us (managing the unavoidable). Managing natural ecosystems as carbon sinks and resources for adaptation is increasingly recognised as a necessary, efficient and relatively cost-effective strategy. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change recommended that governments develop policies for climate sensitive public goods including natural resource protection, coastal protection and emergency preparedness. The worlds protected area network already helps mitigate and adapt to climate change. Protected areas store 15 per cent of terrestrial carbon and supply ecosystem services for disaster reduction, water supply, food and public health, all of which enable community-based adaptation. Many natural and managed ecosystems can help reduce climate change impacts. But protected areas have advantages over other approaches to natural ecosystem management in terms of legal and governance clarity, capacity and effectiveness. In many cases protection is the only way of keeping carbon locked in and ecosystem services running smoothly. Without the investment made in protected areas systems worldwide, the situation would be even worse. Increasing investment through a partnership of governments, communities, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organisations and the private sector would ensure greater protection of these essential services. Evidence suggests that protected areas work: even since this report was completed, a new World Bank review shows how tropical protected areas, especially those conserved by indigenous peoples, lose less forest than other management systems. But these co-benefits for climate, biodiversity and society are often missed or ignored. This book clearly articulates for the first time how protected areas contribute significantly to reducing impacts of climate change and what is needed for them to achieve even more. As we enter an unprecedented scale of negotiations about climate and biodiversity it is important that these messages reach policy makers loud and clear and are translated into effective policies and funding mechanisms.},

abstract = {A new Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) tree-ring width chronology based on living and historic wood spanning the AD 1108–2003 period is developed. This composite record combines 208 high elevation sam- ples from 3 Swiss subalpine valleys, i.e., L¨ otschental, Goms, and Engadine. To retain potential high- to low- frequency information in this dataset, individual spline de- trending and the regional curve standardization are applied. For comparison, 22 high elevation and 6 low-elevation instrumental station records covering the greater Alpine area are used. Previous year August–September precipitation and current year May–July temperatures control spruce ring width back to∼1930. Decreasing (increasing) moving correlations with monthly mean temperatures (precipitation) indicate instable growth/climate response during the 1760– 2002 period. Crucial June–August temperatures before ∼1900 shift towards May-July temperature plus August precipitation sensitivity after ∼1900. Numerous of com- parable subalpine spruce chronologies confirm increased late-summer drought stress, coincidently with the recent warming trend. Comparison with regional-, and large-scale millennial-long temperature reconstructions reveal significant similarities prior to∼1900 (1300–1900 mean r=0.51); however, this study does not fully capture the commonly reported 20th centurywarming (1900–1980 mean r=−0.17). Due to instable growth/climate response of the new spruce chronology, further dendroclimatic reconstruction is not performed.},

abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Rainforests occur in high precipitation areas of eastern Australia, along a gradient in seasonality of precipitation, ranging from a summer dry season in the temperate south to a winter dry season in the tropical north. The response of net photosynthesis to increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was measured in a range of Australian rainforest trees from different latitudes to investigate possible differences in their response to atmospheric drought. Plants were grown in glasshouses under ambient or low VPD to determine the effect of growth VPD on the photosynthetic response. Temperate species, which experience low summer precipitation, were found to maintain maximum net photosynthesis over the measurement range of VPD (0.5-1.9 kPa). In contrast, the tropical species from climates with high summer precipitation showed large reductions in net photosynthesis with increasing VPD. Temperate species showed higher intrinsic water-use efficiencies under low VPD than the tropical species, whereas their efficiencies were similar under high VPD. Growing plants under a low VPD had little effect on either the photosynthetic response to VPD or the intrinsic water-use efficiency of the species. These different responses of gas exchange to VPD shown by the tropical and temperate rainforest species may reflect different strategies to maximise productivity in their respective climates.},

Our meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest restoration enhances biodiversity by 15–84{\%} and vegetation structure by 36–77{\%}, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

abstract = {Leaf veins are almost ubiquitous across the range of terrestrial plant diversity, yet their influence on leaf photosynthetic performance remains uncertain. We show here that specific physical attributes of the vascular plumbing network are key limiters of the hydraulic and photosynthetic proficiency of any leaf. Following the logic that leaf veins evolved to bypass inefficient water transport through living mesophyll tissue, we examined the hydraulic pathway beyond the distal ends of the vein system as a possible limiter of water transport in leaves. We tested a mechanistic hypothesis that the length of this final traverse, as water moves from veins across the mesophyll to where it evaporates from the leaf, governs the hydraulic efficiency and photosynthetic carbon assimilation of any leaf. Sampling 43 species across the breadth of plant diversity from mosses to flowering plants, we found that the post-vein traverse as determined by characters such as vein density, leaf thickness, and cell shape, was strongly correlated with the hydraulic conductivity and maximum photosynthetic rate of foliage. The shape of this correlation provided clear support for the a priori hypothesis that vein positioning limits photosynthesis via its influence on leaf hydraulic efficiency},

abstract = {Precise mapping of above-ground biomass (AGB) is a major challenge for the success of REDD+ processes in tropical rainforest. The usual mapping methods are based on two hypotheses: a large and long-ranged spatial autocorrelation and a strong environment influence at the regional scale. However, there are no studies of the spatial structure of AGB at the landscapes scale to support these assumptions. We studied spatial variation in AGB at various scales using two large forest inventories conducted in French Guiana. The dataset comprised 2507 plots (0.4 to 0.5 ha) of undisturbed rainforest distributed over the whole region. After checking the uncertainties of estimates obtained from these data, we used half of the dataset to develop explicit predictive models including spatial and environmental effects and tested the accuracy of the resulting maps according to their resolution using the rest of the data. Forest inventories provided accurate AGB estimates at the plot scale, for a mean of 325 Mg.ha-1. They revealed high local variability combined with a weak autocorrelation up to distances of no more than10 km. Environmental variables accounted for a minor part of spatial variation. Accuracy of the best model including spatial effects was 90 Mg.ha-1 at plot scale but coarse graining up to 2-km resolution allowed mapping AGB with accuracy lower than 50 Mg.ha-1. Whatever the resolution, no agreement was found with available pan-tropical reference maps at all resolutions. We concluded that the combined weak autocorrelation and weak environmental effect limit AGB maps accuracy in rainforest, and that a trade-off has to be found between spatial resolution and effective accuracy until adequate "wall-to-wall" remote sensing signals provide reliable AGB predictions. Waiting for this, using large forest inventories with low sampling rate ({\textless}0.5{\%}) may be an efficient way to increase the global coverage of AGB maps with acceptable accuracy at kilometric resolution.},

abstract = {In this paper a new model for simulation of the growth of tropical rain forest is presented (FORMIX3). The model describes growth, mortality, recruitment of trees and competition between trees. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance. The carbon gain of a tree depends on the photo production of its leaves, respiration and other losses. Trees compete for light and space. Dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Based on an extensive field data review, a parametrisation was developed for the simulation of lowland Dipterocarp rain forest at Deramakot, Malaysia. A total of 28 variables describing different aspects of forest structure and growth were compared with field data. The model reproduces most parts of the forest dynamics well. A new concept for sensitivity analysis is presented: 46 Model parameter were varied and analysed in respect to their influence on 26 variables describing the forest state. The influence of the different processes on forest structure is complex. Some general trends can be observed: The growth characteristics of the two Dipterocarp species groups strongly influences species composition in the forest, but not general forest structure (biomass, leaf area, production, leaf area, tree size distribution) (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Representing human decisions is of fundamental importance in agent-based models. However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the 'ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD+D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD+D protocol also incorporates a section on 'Theoretical and Empirical Background' to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD+D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social-ecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD+D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD+D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation account for about 20{\%} of global anthropogenic emissions. Strategies and incentives for reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) have emerged as one of the most active areas in the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the current negotiations focus on a REDD mechanism in developing countries, it should be recognized that risks of carbon losses from forests occur in all climate zones and also in industrialized countries. A future climate change agreement would be more effective if it included all carbon losses and gains from land use in all countries and climate zones. The REDD mechanism will be an important step towards reducing emissions from land use change in developing countries, but needs to be followed by steps in other land use systems and regions. A national approach to REDD and significant coverage globally are needed to deal with the risk that deforestation and degradation activities are displaced rather than avoided. Favourable institutional and governance conditions need to be established that guarantee in the long-term a stable incentive and control system for maintaining forest carbon stocks. Ambitious emission reductions from deforestation and forest degradation need sustained financial incentives, which go beyond positive incentives for reduced emissions but also give incentives for sustainable forest management. Current data limitations need - and can be - overcome in the coming years to allow accurate accounting of reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation. A proper application of the conservativeness approach in the REDD context could allow a simplified reporting of emissions from deforestation in a first phase, consistent with the already agreed UNFCCC reporting principles},

abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

abstract = {Though the root biomass of tropical rainforest trees is concentrated in the upper soil layers, soil water uptake by deep roots has been shown to contribute to tree transpiration. A precise evaluation of the relationship between tree dimensions and depth of water uptake would be useful in tree-based modelling approaches designed to anticipate the response of tropical rainforest ecosystems to future changes in environmental conditions. We used an innovative dual-isotope labelling approach (deuterium in surface soil and oxygen at 120-cm depth) coupled with a modelling approach to investigate the role of tree dimensions in soil water uptake in a tropical rainforest exposed to seasonal drought. We studied 65 trees of varying diameter and height and with a wide range of predawn leaf water potential ($\Psi$pd) values. We confirmed that about half of the studied trees relied on soil water below 100-cm depth during dry periods. $\Psi$pd was negatively correlated with depth of water extraction and can be taken as a rough proxy of this depth. Some trees showed considerable plasticity in their depth of water uptake, exhibiting an efficient adaptive strategy for water and nutrient resource acquisition. We did not find a strong relationship between tree dimensions and depth of water uptake. While tall trees preferentially extract water from layers below 100-cm depth, shorter trees show broad variations in mean depth of water uptake. This precludes the use of tree dimensions to parameterize functional models.},

abstract = {Heat and stable isotope tracers were used to study axial and radial water transport in relation to sapwood anatomical characteristics and internal water storage in four canopy tree species of a seasonally dry tropical forest in Panama. Anatomical characteristics of the wood and radial profiles of sap flow were measured at the base, upper trunk, and crown of a single individual of Anacardium excelsum, Ficus insipida, Schefflera morototoni, and Cordia alliodora during two consecutive dry seasons. Vessel lumen diameter and vessel density did not exhibit a consistent trend axially from the base of the stem to the base of the crown. However, lumen diameter decreased sharply from the base of the crown to the terminal branches. The ratio of vessel lumen area to sapwood cross-sectional area was consistently higher at the base of the crown than at the base of the trunk in A. excelsum, F. insipida and C. alliodora, but no axial trend was apparent in S. morototoni. Radial profiles of the preceding wood anatomical characteristics varied according to species and the height at which the wood samples were obtained. Radial profiles of sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation sensors of variable length near the base of the crown were highly correlated with radial profiles of specific hydraulic conductivity (k(s)) calculated from xylem anatomical characteristics. The relationship between sap flux density and k(s) was species-independent. Deuterium oxide (D(2)O) injected into the base of the trunk of the four study trees was detected in the water transpired from the upper crown after only 1 day in the 26-m-tall C. alliodora tree, 2 days in the 28-m-tall F. insipida tree, 3 days in the 38-m-tall A. excelsum tree, and 5 days in the 22-m-tall S. morototoni tree. Radial transport of injected D(2)O was detected in A. excelsum, F. insipida and S. morototoni, but not C. alliodora. The rate of axial D(2)O transport, a surrogate for maximum sap velocity, was positively correlated with the predicted sapwood k(s) and with tree height normalized by the relative diurnal water storage capacity. Residence times for the disappearance of the D(2)O tracer in transpired water ranged from 2 days in C. alliodora to 22 days in A. excelsum and were positively correlated with a normalized index of diurnal water storage capacity. Capacitive exchange of water between stem storage compartments and the transpiration stream thus had a profound influence on apparent rates of axial water transport, the magnitude of radial water movement, and the retention time in the tree of water taken up by the roots. The inverse relationship between internal water exchange capacity and k(s) was consistent with a trade-off contributing to stability of leaf water status through highly efficient water transport at one extreme and release of stored water at the other extreme.},

abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter (QSD, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as QSD increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the FAO to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to FAO data results in a 28 to 47{\%} increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data.},

abstract = {Current forestry practices in Chile largely rely on exotic tree plantations, and limited management experiences are available for the species-rich native evergreen rain forests. Yet, conservationists and forest scientists call for sustainable management of native forests as an alternative to plantations so as to maintain important ecosystem services. We parameterised the process-based forest growth model FORMIND for a Valdivian coastal temperate rain forest in Chilo?? Island, Chile, to assess the ecological implications of different logging practices including selective logging and strip-cutting. We tested the model by comparing simulation results with field data from the study site and carried out an extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the impacts of parameter values on model results. Simulated logging practices were compared in regard to expected timber harvest and long-term impacts on forest structure and composition. Results showed that highest harvests could be achieved when strip-cutting was applied, because it promoted the regeneration of the relatively light-demanding and fast-growing Eucryphia cordifolia. However, forest structure and composition were severely altered by this practice. In contrast, selective logging, although providing lower harvests, better conserved old-growth forest structure and composition. Canopy gaps created by selective logging were not large enough to ensure regeneration of E. cordifolia, but favoured the shade-tolerant Laureliopsis philippiana. Overall, the similarity of logged stands to undisturbed forest decreased linearly with increasing harvesting intensity. Management strategies that rely on native species and keep an uneven-aged forest structure ensure the maintenance of native biodiversity, protect ecosystems from exotic species invasions, and promote the conservation of biotic interactions essential for tree reproduction. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The species composition and structure of the remaining secondary forest as well as the regeneration were analysed. A total of 25 forest stands in the neighbourhood of 25 gaps in an enrichment planting experiment were assessed. A plot of dimension 30 × 30 m was established in each stand. Diameter at breast height (dbh) and height of all trees with dbh {\textgreater} 2 cm were measured. Regeneration of woody plants was assessed in four subplots in each stand. Thirty-six woody species were recorded in the mature stand, representing 35 genera and 30 families. Density of woody species was 734 stems ha-1 and the total basal area was 9.5 m2 ha-1. Regeneration of trees and shrubs was 1,000 saplings and 31,600 seedlings ha-1.

abstract = {Sixty-four different tree-harvesting scenarios in an initially undisturbed Dipterocarp lowland rain forest stand in Sabah (Malaysia) were simulated with the rain forest growth model FORMIND. The scenarios differ in terms of their minimum cutting diameter, logging cycle, method and intensity. The simulation results include harvest yields and the impact on forest structure (canopy opening and changes in species composition). Multicriteria decision analysis was used to evaluate the scenarios and identify optimum ones by applying a stochastic extension of the PROMETHEE method. Almost all optimum scenarios used reduced-impact logging. High cutting limits or low logging intensities could not compensate for the high damage caused by conventional logging techniques. Five scenarios proved to be optimum for a wide range of priorities concerning different forest functions. They all use reduced-impact logging and long logging cycles (≥60 years), either with a minimum cutting limit of 50 or 60 cm stem diameter, or with medium logging intensities. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tropical tree height-diameter (H:D) relationships may vary by forest type and region making large-scale estimates of above-ground biomass subject to bias if they ignore these differences in stem allometry. We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (PV), dry season length (SD), and mean annual air temperature (TA) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within amedian −2.7 to 0.9{\%} of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account.},

These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

abstract = {A comparison is made between the timber certification system of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) of Germany and the PEFC (Pan-European Forest Certification) of Austria. The comparison of timber certification systems by FSC and PEFC for Austria depends on the state of knowledge that includes at this time regular certifications in domestic operations/regions. For lack of domestic FSC implementation determinations the analysis was made with the German FSC determinations. A difference is the sought for global validity according to FSC in contrast to the European approach of the family forest economy according to the PEFC. Regional certification regularly better accommodates this small area structure. PEFC requires at least 70{\%} certified timber for the trade and processing chain "chain of custody" whereas FSC requires only 30{\%} certified timber. There are above all differences in the formulation of goals. PEFC sets in advance a percentage and species limitation and requires special types and living space for the supply of the hemerobie (variety of types). The {\"{O}}GNU (Austrian Environmental Umbrella Organization) expects a small sales potential for FSC certification above all from large operations and industries. The participation possibilities are clearly regulated according to the German model. In Austria, according to the PEFC, there is the principle of unanimity with a right to veto for the {\"{O}}GNU. The acceptance of the PEFC by timber processors is still awaited. PEFC proponents stress the mutual recognition to avoid the loss of image for timber. Both systems are not accepted unconditionally by environmental organizations. Certification organizations are accredited by the FSC itself but as a rule, with respect to the PEFC, they are accredited by the state. Table.},

Here the degree of aggregation in the distribution of 1768 tree species is examined based on the average density of conspecific trees in circular neighborhoods around each tree. When all individuals larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were included, nearly every species was more aggregated than a random distribution. Considering only larger trees (≥ 10 centimeters in diameter), the pattern persisted, with most species being more aggregated than random. Rare species were more aggregated than common species. All six forests were very similar in all the particulars of these results.},

Methodological constraints of the chronological precision and the palaeoclimatic interpretation of records derived from different natural archives, such as glacier sediments and ice cores, lake sediments and palaeo-wetlands, pollen profiles and tree rings are addressed and complementary results con- cerning former climatic conditions are discussed in terms of possible implications of former atmospheric circulation pat- terns and main climatic forcing factors.

abstract = {We describe a strategy for development of chronological control in tropical trees lacking demonstrably annual ring formation, using high resolution delta18O measurements in tropical wood. The approach applies existing models of the oxygen isotopic composition of alpha-cellulose (Roden et al., 2000), a rapid method for cellulose extraction from raw wood (Brendel et al., 2000), and continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Brenna et al., 1998) to develop proxy chronological, rainfall and growth rate estimates from tropical trees lacking visible annual ring structure. Consistent with model predictions, pilot datasets from the temperate US and Costa Rica having independent chronological control suggest that observed cyclic isotopic signatures of several permil (SMOW) represent the annual cycle of local rainfall and relative humidity. Additional data from a plantation tree of known age from ENSO-sensitive northwestern coastal Peru suggests that the 1997-8 ENSO warm phase event was recorded as an 8promille anomaly in the ?? 18O of ??-cellulose. The results demonstrate reproducibility of the stable isotopic chronometer over decades, two different climatic zones, and three tropical tree genera, and point to future applications in paleoclimatology.},

abstract = {Modeling soil water availability for tropical trees is a prerequisite to predicting the future impact of climate change on tropical forests. In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction. Our model thus provides a useful tool to explore the response of tropical forests to climate scenarios of changing rainfall regime and intensity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more 'efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Empirical studies on severely fragmented regions suggest that decades after fragmentation, forest edges located near human-modified areas exhibit the structure of early successional states, with lower biomass per area and higher mortality compared to non-edge areas. These habitat changes (edge effects) can also have a considerable impact on ecosystem processes such as carbon and water balance, which in turn have a major impact on human activities.Using field data from a long-term fragmented landscape in the Brazilian Northeastern Atlantic Forest, and the Forest Model FORMIND, we were able to visualize the time scale in which edge effects influence tropical forests by performing 500-year simulations. We observed changes in community composition, aboveground biomass, total evapotranspiration and total runoff.Averages from ten four-hectare simulations show forest biomass degradation lasting around 100 years. If edge effects cease, recovery of biomass lasts around 150 years. Carbon loss is especially intense during the first five years after fragmentation, resulting in a decline of over 5 Mg ha-1y-1 C. Finally, edges of large fragments face an evapotranspiration loss of 43{\%} and total runoff gains of 57{\%} in relation to core areas of large fragments, suggesting that fragmented landscapes can be of significantly lower value in terms of ecosystem services.},

Our meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest restoration enhances biodiversity by 15–84{\%} and vegetation structure by 36–77{\%}, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

abstract = {The earlywood-vessel area of ring-porous species is related to environmental factors that prevailed during the time of vessel formation. However, limited knowledge is available on the time window during which environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation or flooding can be recorded in vessel area. The susceptibility of vessel area to capture these environmental signals is likely to be related to the timing and duration of vessel formation. Ring-porous species are known to have their new earlywood vessels formed before buds break to guarantee efficient water transport through the large earlywood vessels in the outermost tree ring. However, as leaf phenology differs in ring-porous species, also the timing of vessel formation may vary between species. In this study we investigated the timing and duration of earlywood-vessel formation in relation to phenological status in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) growing at the same site. Microcores were taken from the stem periphery of ten oaks and five ashes in weekly intervals from March to the beginning of June in 2008. Leaf phenology was recorded in the same period. Vessel size was measured from the microcores to relate dynamics in vessel formation to the leaf phenological phases. We found that vessel formation in ash started well before bud swelling and much earlier as compared to oak. Although oak preceded ash in leaf phenology, earlywood-vessel formation in oak started on average more than 13 days later, but vessels enlarged faster than in ash. The formation of all earlywood vessels was completed in both species before leaves were fully expanded.These results indicate that timing and dynamics in vessel formation, as well as the relation between leaf phenology and vessel formation, can considerably differ between ring-porous species. ?? 2011 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia.},

abstract = {Cross-dated tree-ring cores (Pinus merkusii) from north-central Thailand, spanning AD 1620-1780, were used to investigate atmospheric 14C for the tropics during the latter part of the Little Ice Age. In addition, a cross-dated section of Huon pine from western Tasmania, covering the same period of time, was investigated. A total of 16 pairs of decadal samples were extracted to alpha-cellulose for AMS 14C analysis using the ANTARES facility at ANSTO. The 14C results from Thailand follow the trend of the southern hemisphere, rather than that of the northern hemisphere. This is a surprising result, and we infer that atmospheric 14C for north-central Thailand, at 17?? N, was strongly influenced by the entrainment of southern hemisphere air parcels during the southwest Asian monsoon, when the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone moves to the north of our sampling site. Such atmospheric transport and mixing are therefore considered to be one of the principal mechanisms for regional 14C offsets. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Trees of tropical semi-deciduous forests range from "drought-avoiding" stem-succulent species with low-density wood ({\textless} 0.5 g cm(-3)), which maintain high stem water potentials (psi(STEM) {\textgreater} -0.7 MPa) throughout the year, to "drought-tolerant" deciduous hardwood species (wood density {\textgreater} 0.75 g cm(-3)), which dehydrate strongly during seasonal drought (psi(STEM) {\textless} -6 MPa). In stem-succulent and other drought-avoiding species, xylem vessels are surrounded by extensive parenchyma providing intracellular water storage, whereas in deciduous species stem water storage is mainly extracellular. Thirteen tropical and two temperate tree species, representing different functional types, were studied. The contribution of stem water storage to these species' water use during water stress was determined by time-series analysis of dehydration and rehydration of excised leaf-bearing branches of these trees. During dehydration, stem water potential slowly declined 1-2 MPa in drought-avoiding species, but in deciduous species it rapidly fell 4-5 MPa, suggesting that water storage capacitance was related to xylem anatomy. After immersion of dehydrated, leafless branches in water, the decline in xylem tension and rate of water uptake during rehydration were linearly related, as predicted by application of Ohm's law to water flux. The decline of xylem tension during rehydration was biphasic, with a phase of rapid water uptake into extracellular spaces being followed by a prolonged phase of slow water uptake into living cells. The rate of water uptake during rehydration and the minima of leaf water potential observed in the field during the dry season were highly correlated with water storage capacitance, indicating that wood anatomy is a major determinant of drought adaptation.},

abstract = {Cambial activity and the dynamics of xylem and phloem formation were monitored during the 2008 growth season in five chestnut (Castanea sativa) trees growing near Viterbo, Italy. The study was based on microscopic observations of micro-cores taken from stems at weekly intervals from mid-April until mid-October 2008. These observations allowed us to identify the timing of xylem and phloem formation. Cambial divisions, xylem and phloem formation had already started before the first sampling. By the end of April, the first earlywood vessels were already lignified and in early phloem the first formed sieve cells had finished postcambial growth. Formation of earlywood was completed by the end of May, which was about 2-3 weeks earlier than the completion of early phloem. The highest production of xylem cells was recorded between mid-May and mid-June and of phloem ones from mid-June until mid-July. Wood and phloem production mainly terminated in the middle of August while differentiation of xylem cells lasted until mid-October. The phloem ring was completed by the beginning of October 2008. Xylem growth rings were on average 2027 ± 635 $\mu$m wide and phloem rings 265 ± 68 $\mu$m.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neglecting any atmospheric feedback to precipitation, deforestation in Amazon, i.e., replacement of trees by shallow rooted short vegetation, is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET). Under energy-limited conditions, this process should lead to higher soil moisture and a consequent increase in river discharge. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depends both on land-cover change (LCC), and on climate and CO2 concentration changes in the future. Using three regional LCC scenarios recently established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the combined impacts of deforestation and climate change on the surface hydrology of the Amazon basin for this century at sub-basin scale. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three General Circulation Models (GCMs) for different scenarios of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). The GCM results indicate that by 2100, without deforestation, the temperature will have increased by a mean of 3.3{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C (a range of 1.7 to 4.5{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C) over the Amazon basin, intensifing the regional water cycle, whereby precipitation, ET and runoff increase by 8.5, 5.0 and 14{\&}thinsp;{\%}, respectively. However, under this same scenario in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10{\&}thinsp;{\%} at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs estimate a 6{\&}thinsp;{\%} decrease of ET, which does not compensate for lower precipitation. Runoff in southeastern Amazonia decreases by 22{\&}thinsp;{\%}, reducing minimum river discharge from the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s catchment by 31{\&}thinsp;{\%} in 2100. The low LCC scenario projects a 7{\&}thinsp;{\%} decline in the area of Amazonian forest by 2100, as compared to 2009; for the high LCC scenario the projection is a 34{\&}thinsp;{\%} decline. In the extreme deforestation scenario, forest loss partly offsets ({\&}minus;2.5{\&}thinsp;{\%}) the positive effect of climate change on increasing ET and slightly amplifies (+3.0{\&}thinsp;{\%}) the increase of runoff. Effects of deforestation are more pronounced in the southern part of the Amazon basin, in particular in the Rio Madeira catchment where up to 56{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the 2009 forest area is lost. The effect of deforestation on water budgets is more severe at the end of the dry season in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s and the Xingu catchments where the decrease of ET due to climate change is amplified by forest area loss. Deforestation enhances runoff during this period (+35{\&}thinsp;{\%}) offsetting the negative effect of climate change ({\&}minus;22{\&}thinsp;{\%}), and balances the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Variations of both isotope ratios revealed a remarkable annual cyclicity with lowest values occurring at the latewood/earlywood boundary (April-May) and highest values during the transition from earlywood to latewood (October-November). Based on the current knowledge of the physiology of this mangrove species, as well as on the current literature available on high-resolution profiles of stable isotope ratios in tree rings, possible driving forces responsible for this seasonal pattern are discussed. The annual cyclicity, together with a conspicuous isotope pattern appearing in the El-Nino year 1997, promises great potential for tropical dendrochronology.},

In this 14-month study, daily changes in stem radius of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. seedlings were measured with electronic point dendrometers in a plantation in southern Tasmania, Australia. The daily patterns of stem expansion and shrinkage were classified into three phases: shrinkage; recovery; and increase in diameter from one maximum to the next, or increment. This study showed that rapid onset of even mild drought in irrigated trees caused distinct changes in daily patterns of stem diameter variation, particularly the duration of daily stem increment. The duration of the daily increment phase was directly related to increment magnitude. The dynamics of daily increment were significantly affected by mean minimum temperature, indicating a temperature limitation on metabolic processes underlying diameter growth in these trees. Most likely due to differences in conductance, the duration but not rate of the incremental daily expansion was greater in fast- than in slow-growing trees.},

abstract = {Historical climate changes have had a major effect on the distribution and evolution of plant species in the neotropics. What is more controversial is whether relatively recent Pleistocene climatic changes have driven speciation, or whether neotropical species diversity is more ancient. This question is addressed using evolutionary rate analysis of sequence data of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers in diverse taxa occupying neotropical seasonally dry forests, including Ruprechtia (Polygonaceae), robinioid legumes (Fabaceae), Chaetocalyx and Nissolia (Fabaceae), and Loxopterygium (Anacardiaceae). Species diversifications in these taxa occurred both during and before the Pleistocene in Central America, but were primarily pre-Pleistocene in South America. This indicates plausibility both for models that predict tropical species diversity to be recent and that invoke a role for Pleistocene climatic change, and those that consider it ancient and implicate geological factors such as the Andean orogeny and the closure of the Panama Isthmus. Cladistic vicariance analysis was attempted to identify common factors underlying evolution in these groups. In spite of the similar Mid-Miocene to Pliocene ages of the study taxa, and their high degree of endemism in the different fragments of South American dry forests, the analysis yielded equivocal, non-robust patterns of area relationships.},

abstract = {Simulation models for growth of tropical forest can be a useful tool to investigate the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper the rain forest growth model FORMIX3 is used for such a study. As main processes, the FORMIX3 model includes tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. The calculation of tree growth is based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. Two different logging methods (conventional and low impact logging) in combination with different cutting cycles (from 20 to 100 years) were investigated for their long-term impact on the forest. We characterize the impacts with four indicators: total yield, yield per cut, species composition, and canopy opening. Our simulation results indicate that too short logging cycles ({\textless}40 years) overuse this forest. The corresponding yields are low and the species composition is highly disturbed. For conservation of species composition and minimizing erosion risk, logging cycles of 80 or 100 years in combination with low impact methods are recommended. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Question: To establish a habitat classification based on functional group co-occurrence that may help the drawing up of conservation plans. Location: Riverine forest fragments in the Grand-duch{\'{e}} de Luxembourg, Europe. Methods: Forest fragments were surveyed for their abundance of vascular plants. These were clustered into emergent groups according to 14 life-traits related to plant dispersal, establishment and persistence. Forest fragments were classified according to similar distribution of the identified emergent groups. Environmental factors were related to the emergent group richness in each forest type using generalized linear models. Results: Contrary to former species centred classifications, only two groups of forests, each with clearly different emergent group composition and conservation requirements, were detected: (1) swamp forests characterized by anemogamous perennials, annuals and hydrochorous perennials and (2) moist forests characterized by barochorous perennials, small geophytes and zoochorous phanerophytes. From a conservation point of view, priority should be given to large swamp forest with intact flooding regimes. This is in accordance with the high wind and water dispersal capacities of their typical emergent groups. For the moist forests, conservation priorities should be high forest connectivity and historical continuity since dispersal and establishment of their characteristic emergent groups are highly limited. Conclusions: The described methodology, situated at an intermediate integration level between the individual species and whole community descriptors, takes advantage of both conservation plans built for single species and the synthetic power of broad ecological measures.},

@article{Chambers2013a,
abstract = {Old-growth forest ecosystems comprise a mosaic of patches in different successional stages, with the fraction of the landscape in any particular state relatively constant over large temporal and spatial scales. The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass⋅ha(-1)⋅y(-1) were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a sawtooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO(2) fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9{\%} of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.},

@article{Copenheaver2011,
abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine whether the dendroclimatic responses of young Quercus alba (aged 29-126 years) differ from those of old Q. alba (149-312 years). We collected Q. alba increment cores across a range of size classes from Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve, an oak-hickory forest in southcentral Virginia, USA. Tree cores were crossdated and raw ring widths were detrended to remove the influence of increasing circumference with age, microsite, and local stand dynamics. Standardized ring widths were averaged to develop two master chronologies from the 20 oldest and youngest trees. Ring-width indices were correlated with temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Annual tree-ring growth in old and young Q. alba was significantly correlated with precipitation from the previous growing season, but was not significantly correlated with temperature. Only the old trees showed a significant correlation between annual ring width and PDSI. These results may indicate that growth in old trees is more sensitive to drought than in young trees. If future climate change includes the predicted increase in mid-growing season droughts, tree-level responses are likely to be age-dependent with older trees experiencing relatively greater reductions in growth.},

@article{Hobohm2005,
abstract = {The concepts of biodiversity hotspots as developed at the end of the 1980s by Norman Myers is currently one of the leading approaches in global nature conservation strategies. The current paper addresses the question, if and to what extent this concept can be transferred to the regional and local dimen- sions of Europe. A proposal is put forward on how to define and identify European biodiversity hotspots. The localisation of endemic taxa and the study of ecological factors for the diversity of endemics and other species play a considerable role in the study of biodiversity hotspots. Low productivity agricultural lands, taken in broadest sense, are often very species-rich in Europe and harbour many endemic taxa. The very existence of these habitats is however threatened across Europe as agricultural practises are either intensified or abandoned altogether. The result is a reduction of the total area as well as subtle changes and the decline of local and regional species diversity and fragmentation of populations. In many cases, the corresponding plant communities and landscapes represent, or play a decisive role in forming, the biodiversity hotspots of Europe.},
